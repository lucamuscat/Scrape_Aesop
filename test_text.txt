The Olive Tree and the Fig Tree
The olive tree ridiculed the fig tree because, while she was green all the year round, the fig tree changed its leaves with the seasons. A shower of snow fell upon them and, finding the olive full of foliage, it settled upon its branches. At length the olive tree's branches broke with the snow's weight, at once despoiling it of its beauty and killing the tree. Finding the fig tree without leaves, the snow fell through the branches to the ground and did not injure it at all.

The Buck and the Vine
A buck, pursued by hunters, concealed himself among the branches of a vine. The hunters passed by without discovering him, and when he thought that all was safe, he began browsing upon the leaves that had concealed him. One of the hunters, attracted by the rustling, turned round and guessing that their prey was there, shot into the bush and killed him. As he was dying, he groaned out these words; "I suffer justly for my ingratitude, who could not forbear injuring the vine that had protected me in time of danger."

The Fir Tree and the Bramble
A fir tree was one day boasting itself to a bramble. "You are of no use at all, but how could barns and houses be built without me?"
"Good sir," said the bramble, "when the woodmen come here with their axes and saws, what would you give to be a bramble and not a fir?"
A humble lot in security is better than the dangers that encompass the high and haughty.

The Trees and the Axe
A woodman came into a forest to ask the trees to give him a handle for his axe. It seemed so modest a request that the principal trees at once agreed to it, and it was settled among them that a plain, homely ash tree should furnish what was wanted.
No sooner had the woodman fitted the wood to his purpose, than he began laying about him on all sides, felling the noblest trees in the wood. The oak, now seeing the whole matter too late, whispered to the cedar, "The first concession has lost all. If we had not sacrificed our humble neighbor, we might have yet stood for ages ourselves."

The Travelers and the Plane Tree
Some travelers, on a hot day in summer, oppressed with the noontide sun, perceiving a plane tree near at hand, made straight for it. Throwing themselves on the ground, they rested under its shade. Looking up towards the tree, they said one to another, "What a useless tree to man is this barren plane!" But the plane tree answered them, "Ungrateful creatures! At the very moment that you are enjoying benefit from me, you rail at me as being good for nothing."
Ingratitude is as blind as it is base.

The Boy and the Nettle
A boy playing in the fields was stung by a nettle. He ran home to his mother, telling her that he had but touched that nasty weed and it had stung him. "It was just your touching it, my boy," said the mother, "that caused it to sting you; the next time you meddle with a nettle, grasp it tightly and it will do you no hurt."
Do boldly what you do at all.

The Pomegranate, the Apple, and the Bramble
The pomegranate and the apple had a contest on the score of beauty. When words ran high and the strife waxed dangerous, a bramble, thrusting his head from a neighboring bush, cried out, "We have disputed long enough; let there be no more rivalry betwixt us."
The most insignificant are generally the most presuming.

The Vine and the Goat
There was a vine teeming with ripe fruit and tender shoots, when a wanton goat came up and gnawed the bark and browsed upon the young leaves. "I will revenge myself on you," said the vine, "for this insult; for when in a few days you are brought as a victim to the altar, the juice of my grapes shall be the dew of death upon your forehead."
Retribution, though late, comes at last.

The Tortoise and the Hare
A hare jeered at a tortoise for the slowness of his pace. But he laughed and said that he would run against her and beat her any day she would name. "Come on," said the hare, "you shall soon see what my feet are made of."
So it was agreed that they should start at once. The tortoise went off jogging along, without a moment's stopping, at his usual steady pace. The hare, treating the whole matter very lightly, said she would first take a little nap, and that she should soon overtake the tortoise. Meanwhile the tortoise plodded on and the hare, oversleeping herself, arrived at the goal, only to see that the tortoise had got in before her.
There are several possible morals for this fable:
Consistency, even slow consistency, beats inconsistency every time.
Slow but sure wins the race.

The Hound and the Hare
A hound, after long chasing a hare, at length came up to her and kept first biting and then licking her. The hare, not knowing what to make of him, said; "If you are a friend, why do you bite me? But if you are a foe, why do you caress me?"
A doubtful friend is worse than a certain enemy. Let a man be one thing or the other and we then know how to meet him.

The Eagle and the Beetle
A hare, being pursued by an eagle, took himself for refuge to the nest of a beetle, whom he entreated to save him. The beetle therefore interceded with the eagle, begging of him not to kill the poor suppliant, and pleaded with him, by mighty Jupiter, not to break the laws of hospitality because he was so small an animal. But the eagle, in wrath, gave the beetle a flap of his wing, and straightway seized upon the hare and devoured him.
When the eagle flew away, the beetle flew after him, to learn where his nest was. Getting into the nest, the beetle rolled the eagle's eggs out of it one by one and broke them. The eagle, grieved and enraged to think that any one should attempt so audacious a thing, built his nest the next time in a higher place. But there, too, the beetle got at it again and served him in the same manner as before.
Upon this the eagle, being at a loss what to do, flew up to Jupiter, his Lord and King, and placed the third brood of eggs as a sacred deposit in his lap, begging him to guard them for him. But the beetle, having made a little ball of dirt, flew up with it and dropped it in Jupiter's lap, who, rising up on a sudden to shake it off and forgetting the eggs, threw them down and they were again broken.
Jupiter, being informed by the beetle that he had done this to be revenged upon the eagle who had not only wronged him, but had acted impiously towards Jove himself, told the eagle, when he came to him, that the beetle was the aggrieved party and that he complained not without reason. Being unwilling that the race of eagles should be diminished, he advised the beetle to come to peace with the eagle. As the beetle would not agree to this, Jupiter transferred the eagle's breeding to another season, when there are no beetles to be seen.
No one can slight the laws of hospitality with impunity; and there is no station or influence, however powerful, that can protect the oppressor, in the end, from the vengeance of the oppressed.

The Kingdom of the Lion
The beasts of the field and forest had a lion as their king. He was neither wrathful, cruel, nor tyrannical, but he was just and gentle as a king could be. He made during his reign a royal proclamation for a general assembly of all the birds and beasts, and drew up conditions for a universal league, in which the wolf and the lamb, the panther and the kid, the tiger and the stag, the dog and the hare, should live together in perfect peace and amity. The hare said; "Oh, how I have longed to see this day, in which the weak shall take their place without fear by the side of the strong."

The Hare and the Hound
A hound having put up a hare from a bush, chased her for some distance, but the hare had the best of it, and got off. A goatherd who was coming by jeered at the hound, saying that puss was the better runner of the two. "You forget," replied the hound, "that it is one thing to be running for your dinner and another for your life."

The Hares and the Frogs
Once upon a time the hares, driven desperate by the many enemies that compassed them about on every side, came to the sad resolution that there was nothing left for them but to make away with themselves, one and all. Off they scudded to a nearby lake, determined to drown themselves as the most miserable of creatures.
A shoal of frogs seated upon the bank, frightened at the approach of the hares, leaped in the greatest alarm and confusion into the water. "Nay, then, my friends," said a hare that was foremost, "our case is not so desperate yet, for here are other poor creatures more faint-hearted than ourselves."

The Ass and His Driver
An ass that was being driven along the road by his master started on ahead, leaving the beaten track, and headed as fast as he could for the edge of a precipice. When he was just on the point of falling over, his master ran up and, seizing him by the tail, endeavored to pull him back. Because the ass resisted and pulled the other way, the man let go of his hold, saying, "Well, Jack, if you will be master, I cannot help it. A willful beast must go his own way."

The Ass, the Fox, and the Lion
An ass and a fox, having made a compact alliance, went out into the fields to hunt. They met a lion on the way. The fox, seeing the danger, made up to the lion and whispered that he would betray the ass into his power if he would promise to bear him harmless. The lion agreed and the Fox contrived to lead the ass into a snare. The lion no sooner saw the ass secured than he fell at once upon the fox, reserving the other for his next meal.

The Ass, the Cock, and the Lion
An ass and a cock lived in a farmyard together. One day a hungry lion passing by and, seeing the ass in good condition, resolved to make a meal of him. Now, they say that there is nothing a lion hates so much as the crowing of a cock, and at that moment the cock happened to crow. The lion straightway made off with all haste from the spot.
The ass, mightily amused to think that a lion should be frightened at a bird, plucked up the courage and galloped after him, delighted with the notion of driving the king of beasts before him. He had, however, gone no great distance, when the lion turned sharply round upon him and made an end of him in a trice.
Presumption begins in ignorance and ends in ruin.

The Ass and His Purchaser
A man wished to purchase an ass, and agreed with his owner that he should try him before he bought him. He took the ass home and put him in the straw-yard with the other asses, upon which he left all the others and joined himself at once to the idlest and the greatest eater of them all. The man put a halter on him and led him back to his owner; and on his inquiring how, in so short a time, he could have made a trial of him, "I do not need," he answered, "a trial; I know that he will be just such another as the one whom of all the rest he chose for his companion."
A man is known by the company he keeps.

The Ass and the Old Shepherd
A shepherd watched his ass feeding in a meadow. Being suddenly alarmed by the cries of the enemy, he appealed to the ass to fly with him, lest they should both be captured. The ass lazily replied, "Why should I? Do you think it likely the conqueror will place on me two sets of panniers?" "No," rejoined the shepherd. "Then," said the ass, "as long as I carry the panniers, what matters it to me whom I serve?"
In a change of government the poor change nothing beyond the name of their master.

The Jackass in Office
An ass carrying an image in a religious procession was driven through a town and all the people who passed by made a low reverence. Upon this the ass, supposing that they intended this worship for himself, was mightily puffed up, and would not budge another step. But the driver soon laid the stick across his back, saying at the same time, "You silly dolt! It is not you that they reverence, but the image which you carry."
Fools take to themselves the respect that is given to their office.

The Goat and the Ass
A man once kept a goat and an ass. The goat, envying the ass on account of his greater abundance of food, said: "How shamefully you are treated; at one time grinding in the mill, and at another carrying heavy burden." And he further advised him that he should pretend to be epileptic, and fall into a ditch, and so obtain rest. The ass followed his advice and, falling into a ditch, was very much bruised. His master, sending for a leech, asked his advice. He bade him place upon the wounds the liver of a goat. They at once killed the goat and so healed the ass.

The Ass Carrying Salt
A certain huckster who kept an ass, hearing that salt was to be had cheap at the seaside, drove his ass there to buy some. Having loaded the beast as much as he could bear, he was driving him home, when, as they were passing a slippery ledge of rock, the ass fell into the stream below. The salt melted and the ass was relieved of his burden. Having gained the bank with ease, the ass pursued his journey onward, light in body and in spirit.
The huckster soon afterwards set off for the seashore for some more salt. He loaded the ass, if possible, more heavily than before. On their return, as they crossed the stream into which he had formerly fallen, the ass fell down on purpose and, by dissolving the salt, was again released from his load.
The master, provoked at the loss, and thinking how he might cure him of this trick, on his next journey to the coast freighted the beast with a load of sponges. When they arrived at the same stream as before, the ass was at his old tricks again and rolled himself into the water. He found to his cost that the sponges, becoming thoroughly wet, instead of lightening his burden, he had more than doubled its weight.
The same measures will not suit all circumstances and we may play the same trick once too often.

The Ass and the Wolf
An ass, grazing in a field, saw a wolf come forward to seize him and immediately pretended to be lame. The wolf, coming up, inquired the cause of his lameness. The ass said that passing through a hedge he trod with his foot upon a sharp thorn, and requested the wolf to pull it out, lest when he supped on him it should injure his throat.
The wolf consented and lifted up the ass' foot, giving his whole mind to the discovery of the thorn. The ass, with his heels, kicked his teeth into his mouth and galloped away.
The wolf, being thus fearfully injured, said, "I am rightly served, for why did I attempt the art of healing, when my father only taught me the trade of a butcher?"

The Lion and Ass Hunting
Lion and an ass made an agreement to go out hunting together. By and by they came to a cave, where many wild goats abode. The lion took up his station at the mouth of the cave and the ass, going within, kicked and brayed and made a mighty fuss to frighten them out. When the lion had caught many of them, the ass came out and asked him if he had not made a noble fight, and routed the goats properly.
"Yes, indeed," said the lion, "and I assure you, you would have frightened me too, if I had not known you to be an ass."
When braggarts are admitted into the company of their betters, it is only to be made use of and be laughed at.

The Lion, the Ass, and the Fox
The lion, the ass, and the fox formed a party to go out hunting. They took a large booty and, when the sport was ended, thought to have a hearty meal.
The lion bade the ass to share the spoil. So, dividing it into three equal parts, the ass begged his friends to make their choice. The lion, in great indignation, fell upon the ass and tore him to pieces.
The lion then bade the fox to make a division. Gathering the whole into one great heap, the fox reserved but the smallest mite for himself. "Ah, friend," said the lion, "who taught you to make so equitable a division?" "I wanted no other lesson," replied the fox, "than the ass' fate."
Better be wise by the misfortunes of others than by your own.

The Ass in the Lion's Skin
An ass, having put on a lion's skin, roamed about, frightening all the silly animals he met with. Seeing a fox, he tried to alarm him also. But Reynard, having heard his voice, said, "Well, to be sure! And I should have been frightened too, if I had not heard you bray."
They who assume a character that does not belong to them generally betray themselves.

The Horse and the Loaded Ass
A man who kept a horse and an ass was wont in his journeys to spare the horse and put the entire burden upon the ass' back. The ass, who had been ailing for some time, besought the horse one day to relieve him of part of his load. "For if," said he, "you would take a fair portion, I shall soon get well again; but if you refuse to help me, this weight will kill me."
The horse, however, bade the ass get on and not trouble him with his complaints. The ass jogged on in silence, but presently, overcome with the weight of his burden, dropped down dead, as he had foretold. Upon this, the master unloosed the load from the dead ass and, putting it upon the horse's back, made him carry the ass' carcass in addition.
"Alas, for my ill nature!" said the horse. "By refusing to bear my just portion of the load, I have now to carry the whole of it, with a dead weight in the bargain."
A disobliging temper carries its own punishment.

The Ass and the Lap Dog
There were an ass and a lap dog who belonged to the same master. The ass was tied up in the stable, had plenty of corn and hay to eat, and was as well off as an ass could be. The little dog was always sporting and gamboling about, caressing and fawning upon his master in a thousand amusing ways, so that he became a great favorite, and was permitted to lie in his master's lap.
The ass, indeed, had enough to do; he was drawing wood all day and had to take his turn at the mill at night. But while he grieved over his own lot, it galled him more to see the lap dog living in such ease and luxury.
Thinking that if he acted a like part to his master, he should fare the same, he broke one day from his halter and, rushing into the hall, began to kick and prance about in the strangest fashion. Swishing his tail and mimicking the frolics of the favorite, he upset the table where his master was at dinner, breaking it in two and smashing all the crockery. Nor would he stop until he jumped upon his master and pawed him with his rough-shod feet.
The servants, seeing their master in no little danger, thought it was now high time to interfere. Having released him from the ass' caresses, they so belabored the silly creature with sticks and staves that he never got up again. As he breathed his last, he exclaimed, "Why could not I have been satisfied with my natural position, without attempting, by tricks and grimaces, to imitate one who was but a puppy after all!"

The Fly and the Draught-Mule
A fly sat on the axle of a chariot and, addressing the draught-mule, said, "How slow you are! Why do you not go faster? See if I do not prick your neck with my sting."
The draught-mule replied, "I do not heed your threats. I only care for him who sits above you, and who quickens my pace with his whip or holds me back with the reins. Away, therefore, with your insolence, for I know well when to go fast and when to go slow."

The Ass's Shadow
A youth, one hot summer's day, hired an ass to carry him from Athens to Megara. At mid-day the heat of the sun was so scorching that he dismounted and would have sat down to repose himself under the shadow of the ass. But the driver of the ass disputed the place with him, declaring that he had an equal right to it with the other.
"What!" said the youth, "did I not hire the ass for the whole journey?" "Yes," said the other, "you hired the ass, but not the ass' shadow." While they were thus wrangling and fighting for the place, the ass took to his heels and ran away.

The Miller, His Son, and Their Ass
A miller and his son were driving their ass to a neighboring fair to sell him. They had not gone far when they met with a troop of girls returning from the town, talking and laughing. "Look there!" cried one of them, "did you ever see such fools, to be trudging along the road on foot, when they might be riding!"
The old man, hearing this, quietly bade his son get on the ass, and walked along merrily by the side of him. Presently they came up to a group of old men in earnest debate. "There!" said one of them, "it proves what I was saying. What respect is shown to old age in these days? Do you see that idle young rogue riding, while his old father has to walk? Get down, you scapegrace! And let the old man rest his weary limbs."
Upon this the father made his son dismount and got up himself. In this manner they had not proceeded far when they met a company of women and children. "Why, you lazy old fellow!" cried several tongues at once, "how can you ride upon the beast, while that poor little lad there can hardly keep pace by the side of you?"
The good-natured miller stood corrected and immediately took up his son behind him. They had now almost reached the town. "Pray, honest friend," said a townsman, "is that ass your own?" "Yes," said the old Man. "Oh! One would not have thought so," said the other, "by the way you load him. Why, you two fellows are better able to carry the poor beast than he you!" "Anything to please you," said the old man; "we can but try."
So, alighting with his son, they tied the ass' legs together and by the help of a pole endeavored to carry him on their shoulders over a bridge that led to the town. This was so entertaining a sight that the people ran out in crowds to laugh at it, till the ass, not liking the noise or his situation, kicked asunder the cords that bound him and, tumbling off the pole, fell into the river.
Upon this the old man, vexed and ashamed, made his way home, convinced that by endeavoring to please everybody he had pleased nobody and lost his ass in the bargain.

The Old Lion
A lion, worn out with years, lay stretched upon the ground utterly helpless and drawing his last breath. A boar came up and, to satisfy an ancient grudge, drove at him with his tusks. Next a bull, determined to be revenged on an old enemy, gored him with his horns.
Upon this an ass, seeing that the old lion could thus be treated with impunity, thought that he would show his spite also. He came and threw his heels in the lion's face, whereupon the dying beast exclaimed; "The insults of the powerful were bad enough; those I could have managed to bear. But to be spurned by so base a creature as thou, the disgrace of nature, is to die a double death."

The Charger and the Ass
A charger adorned with fine trappings came thundering along the road, exciting the envy of a poor ass who was trudging along the same way with a heavy load on his back. "Get out of my road!" said the proud horse, "or I shall trample you under my feet." The ass said nothing, but quietly moved on one side to let the horse pass.
Not long afterwards the charger was engaged in the wars and, being badly wounded in battle, was rendered unfit for military service and sent to work upon a farm. When the ass saw him dragging with great labor a heavy wagon, he understood how little reason he had had to envy one who, by his overbearing spirit in the time of his prosperity, had lost those friends who might have succored him in time of need.

The Mules and the Robbers
Two mules well laden with packs were trudging along. One carried panniers filled with money, the other, sacks weighted with grain. The mule carrying the treasure walked with head erect, as if conscious of the value of his burden, and tossed up and down the clear-toned bells fastened to his neck. His companion followed with quiet and easy steps.
Suddenly robbers rushed from their hiding-places upon them, and in the scuffle with their owners, wounded with a sword the mule carrying the treasure, which they greedily seized upon, while they took no notice of the grain.
The mule which had been robbed and wounded, bewailed his misfortunes. The other replied; "I am indeed glad that I was thought so little of, for I have lost nothing, nor am I hurt with any wound."

The Ass and the Frogs
An ass, carrying a load of wood, passed through a pond. As he was crossing through the water he lost his footing, stumbled, and fell. Not being able to rise on account of his load, he groaned heavily.
Some frogs frequenting the pool heard his lamentation and said; "What would you do if you had to live here always as we do, when you make a fuss about a mere fall into the water?"
Men often bear little grievances with less courage than they do large misfortunes.

The Ass and the Grasshopper
An ass, hearing some grasshoppers chirping, was delighted with the music and determined, if he could, to rival them. He asked them what it was that they fed upon to make them sing so sweetly. When they told him that they supped upon nothing but dew, the ass betook himself to the same diet, and soon died of hunger.
One man's meat is another man's poison.

The Mule
A mule that had grown fat and wanton on too great an allowance of corn was one day jumping and kicking about. At length, cocking up her tail, she exclaimed, "My mother was a racer, and I am quite as good as ever she was." But being soon exhausted with her galloping and frisking, she remembered all at once that her father was but an ass.
Every truth has two sides. It is well to look at both before we commit ourselves to either.

The Ass and His Masters
An ass that belonged to a gardener, and had little to eat and much to do, besought Jupiter to release him from the gardener's service and give him another master. Jupiter, angry at his discontent, gave him over to a potter. He had now heavier burdens to carry than before and again appealed to Jupiter to relieve him, who accordingly contrived that he should be sold to a tanner.
The ass having now fallen into worse hands than ever, and daily observing how his master was employed, exclaimed with a groan; "Alas, wretch that I am! It had been better for me to have remained content with my former masters, for now I see that my present owner not only works me harder while living, but will not even spare my hide when I am dead!"
He that is discontented in one place will seldom be happy in another.

The Wolf and the Horse
As a wolf was roaming over a farm, he came to a field of oats Not being able to eat them, he left them and went his way. Presently meeting with a horse, he bade him come with him into the field; "For," says he, "I have found some capital oats, and I have not tasted one, but have kept them all for you, for the very sound of your teeth is music to my ear."
But the horse replied, "A pretty fellow! If wolves were able to eat oats, I suspect you would not have preferred your ears to your appetite."
Little thanks are due to him who only gives away what is of no use to himself.

The Horse and the Groom
A groom who used to steal and sell a horse's corn, was yet very busy in grooming and wisping him all the day long. "If you really wish me," said the horse, "to look well, give me less of your currying and more of your corn."

The Charger and the Ass
A charger adorned with fine trappings came thundering along the road, exciting the envy of a poor ass who was trudging along the same way with a heavy load on his back. "Get out of my road!" said the proud horse, "or I shall trample you under my feet." The ass said nothing, but quietly moved on one side to let the horse pass.
Not long afterwards the charger was engaged in the wars and, being badly wounded in battle, was rendered unfit for military service and sent to work upon a farm. When the ass saw him dragging with great labor a heavy wagon, he understood how little reason he had had to envy one who, by his overbearing spirit in the time of his prosperity, had lost those friends who might have succored him in time of need.

The Horse and His Rider
A soldier took the utmost pains with his charger. As long as the war lasted, he looked upon him as his fellow-helper in all emergencies, and fed him carefully with hay and corn. When the war was over, he only allowed him chaff to eat, made him carry heavy loads of wood, and subjected him to much slavish drudgery and ill-treatment.
War, however, once again proclaimed, and the trumpet summoning him to his standard, the soldier put on his charger the military trappings and mounted in his heavy coat of mail. The horse fell down straightway under the weight, no longer equal to the burden, and said to his master, "You must now go to the war on foot, for you have transformed me from a horse into an ass and how can you expect that I can again turn in a moment from an ass to a horse?"

The Horse and the Loaded Ass
A man who kept a horse and an ass was wont in his journeys to spare the horse and put the entire burden upon the ass' back. The ass, who had been ailing for some time, besought the horse one day to relieve him of part of his load. "For if," said he, "you would take a fair portion, I shall soon get well again; but if you refuse to help me, this weight will kill me."
The horse, however, bade the ass get on and not trouble him with his complaints. The ass jogged on in silence, but presently, overcome with the weight of his burden, dropped down dead, as he had foretold. Upon this, the master unloosed the load from the dead ass and, putting it upon the horse's back, made him carry the ass' carcass in addition.
"Alas, for my ill nature!" said the horse. "By refusing to bear my just portion of the load, I have now to carry the whole of it, with a dead weight in the bargain."
A disobliging temper carries its own punishment.

The Horse and the Stag
A horse had the whole range of a meadow to himself, but a stag come and damaged the pasture. The horse, anxious to have his revenge, asked a man if he could not assist him in punishing the stag. "Yes," said the man, "only let me put a bit in your mouth and get upon your back and I will find the weapons." The horse agreed and the man mounted accordingly. But instead of getting his revenge, the horse has been from that time forward the slave of man.
Revenge is too dearly purchased at the price of liberty.

The Man, the Horse, the Ox, and the Dog
A horse, ox, and dog, driven to great straits by the cold, sought shelter and protection from a man. He received them kindly, lighted a fire, and warmed them. He allowed the horse to eat of his oats, gave the ox an abundance of hay, and fed the dog with meat from his own table.
Grateful for these favors, they determined to repay him to the best of their ability. They divided for this purpose the term of his life between them, and each endowed one portion of it with the qualities that chiefly characterized himself.
The horse chose the man's earliest years and endowed them with his own attributes. Hence every man is in youth impetuous, headstrong, and obstinate in maintaining his own opinion.
The ox took under his patronage the next term of life, and therefore man in his middle age is fond of work, devoted to labor, and resolute to amass wealth and to husband his resources.
The end of life was reserved to the dog, wherefore the old man is often snappish, irritable, hard to please, and selfish, tolerant only of his own household, but averse to strangers and to all who do not administer to his comfort or to his necessities.

The He-Goat and the Wolf
A wolf some time ran after a he-goat, and the he-goat, to save himself, leapt upon a rock where the wolf besieged him. After they had dwelled there two or three days, the wolf began to wax hungry and the he-goat thirsty. So the wolf went to eat and the he-goat went to drink.
As the he-goat drank he saw his shadow in the water. Spying and beholding his shadow, he said to himself, "Thou hast so fair legs, so fair a beard, and so fair horns, and hast fear of the wolf! If it happen that he come again, I shall correct him well and shall keep him well, that he shall have no might over me."
The wolf, who held his peace and hearkened what was said, took him by one leg, thus saying; "What words be these which I hear, brother he-goat?" When the he-goat saw that he was taken, he began to say to the wolf, "Ha! My lord, I say nothing and have pity on me! I know well that it is to my blame." Yet the wolf took him by the neck and strangled him.
It is great folly when the feeble makes war against the powerful and strong.

The Boy Who Cried Wolf
A shepherd boy, who tended his flock not far from a village, used to amuse himself at times in crying out "Wolf! Wolf!" Twice or thrice his trick succeeded; the whole village came running out to his assistance, when all the return they got was to be laughed at for their pains.
At last one day the wolf came indeed. The boy cried out in earnest. His neighbors, supposing him to be at his old sport, paid no heed to his cries, and the wolf devoured the sheep. So the boy learned, when it was too late, that liars are not believed even when they tell the truth.

The Kid and the Wolf
A kid that had strayed from the herd was pursued by a wolf. When she saw all other hope of escape cut off, she turned round to the wolf and said, "I must allow indeed that I am your victim, but as my life is now but short, let it be a merry one. Do you pipe for a while, and I will dance."
While the wolf was piping and the kid was dancing, the dogs hearing the music ran up to see what was going on, and the wolf was glad to take himself off as fast as his legs would carry him
The Wolf and the Crane
A wolf had got a bone stuck in his throat and in the greatest agony ran up and down, beseeching every animal he met to relieve him, at the same time hinting at a very handsome reward to the successful operator. A crane, moved by his entreaties and promises, ventured her long neck down the wolf's throat, and drew out the bone. She then modestly asked for the promised reward. To which the wolf, grinning and showing his teeth, replied with seeming indignation; "Ungrateful creature! To ask for any other reward than that you have put your head in a wolf's jaws, and brought it safe out again!"

The Wolf and the Lion
A wolf, roaming by the mountain's side, saw his own shadow, as the sun was setting, become greatly extended and magnified, and he said to himself; "Why should I, being of such an immense size, and extending nearly an acre in length, be afraid of the Lion? Ought I not to be acknowledged as King of all the collected beasts?" While he was indulging in these proud thoughts, a Lion fell upon him and killed him. He exclaimed with a too-late repentance; "Wretched me! This over estimation of myself is the cause of my destruction."

The Stag, the Wolf, and the Sheep
A stag asked a sheep to lend him a measure of wheat and said that the wolf would be his surety. The sheep, fearing some fraud was intended, excused herself, saying; "The wolf is accustomed to seize what he wants and to run off and you, too, can quickly outstrip me in your rapid flight. How then shall I be able to find either of you when the day of payment comes?"
Two blacks do not make one white.

The House Dog and the Wolf
A lean, hungry wolf chanced one moonlit night to fall in with a plump, well-fed house dog. After the first compliments were passed between them, "How is it, my friend," said the wolf, "that you look so sleek? How well your food agrees with you! And here am I striving for my living night and day and can hardly save myself from starving."
"Well," says the dog, "if you would fare like me, you have only to do as I do." "Indeed!" says he, "and what is that?" "Why," replied the dog, "just to guard the master's house and keep off the thieves at night." "With all my heart; for at present I have but a sorry time of it. This woodland life, with its frosts and rains, is sharp work for me. To have a warm roof over my head and a bellyful of victuals always at hand will, I think, not be a bad exchange." "True," said the dog; "therefore you have nothing to do but to follow me."
Now as they were jogging on together, the wolf spied a mark in the dog's neck, and having a strange curiosity, could not resist asking what it meant. "Pooh! Nothing at all," says the dog. "No, tell me" said the wolf. "Oh! A mere trifle, perhaps the collar to which my chain is fastened."
"Chain!" cried the wolf in surprise; "you don't mean that you cannot rove when and where you please?" "Why, not exactly perhaps; you see I am looked upon as rather fierce, so they sometimes tie me up in the daytime, but I assure you I have perfect liberty at night. The master feeds me off his own plate and the servants give me their tidbits. I am such a favorite, so what is the matter? Where are you going?"
"Oh, good night to you," said the wolf; "you are welcome to your dainties; but for me, a dry crust with liberty against a king's luxury with a chain."

The Wolf and the Lion
One day a wolf seized a sheep from a fold and was carrying it home to his own den. He met a lion that straightway laid hold of the sheep and bore it away. The wolf, standing at a distance, cried out that it was a great shame and that the lion had robbed him of his own. The lion laughed and said, "I suppose, then, that it was your good friend the shepherd who gave it to you."

The Lion and His Three Councilors
The lion called the sheep to ask her if his breath smelled. She said Aye, so he bit off her head for a fool. He called the wolf and asked him. He said No, so he tore him in pieces for a flatterer. At last he called the fox and asked him. Truly he had got a cold, and could not smell.
Wise men say nothing in dangerous times.

The Shepherd and the Wolf
A shepherd once found the whelp of a wolf, and brought it up, and after a while taught it to steal lambs from the neighboring flocks. The Wolf, having shown himself an apt pupil, said to the Shepherd; "Since you have taught me to steal, you must keep a sharp look-out, or you will lose some of your own flock."

The Wolf in Sheep's Clothing
A wolf, once upon a time, resolved to disguise himself, thinking that he should thus gain an easier livelihood. Having, therefore, clothed himself in a sheep's skin, he contrived to get among a flock of sheep and feed along with them, so that even the shepherd was deceived by the imposture.
When night came on and the fold was closed, the wolf was shut up with the sheep and the door made fast. But the shepherd, wanting something for his supper, and going in to fetch out a sheep, mistook the wolf for one of them and killed him on the spot.

The Wolf and the Skull
A wolf found a dead man's head, which he turned upside down with his foot. He said, "Ah ha! How fair hast thou been and pleasant. And now thou hast in thee neither wit nor beauty; and thou art without voice and without thought." Therefore men ought not only to behold the beauty and fairness of the body, but also the goodness and the courage.

The Ass and the Wolf
An ass, grazing in a field, saw a wolf come forward to seize him and immediately pretended to be lame. The wolf, coming up, inquired the cause of his lameness. The ass said that passing through a hedge he trod with his foot upon a sharp thorn, and requested the wolf to pull it out, lest when he supped on him it should injure his throat.
The wolf consented and lifted up the ass' foot, giving his whole mind to the discovery of the thorn. The ass, with his heels, kicked his teeth into his mouth and galloped away.
The wolf, being thus fearfully injured, said, "I am rightly served, for why did I attempt the art of healing, when my father only taught me the trade of a butcher?"

The Blind Man and the Whelp
A blind man was wont, on any animal being put into his hands, to say what it was. Once they brought to him a wolf's whelp. He felt it all over and, being in doubt, said, "I know not whether thy father was a dog or a wolf; but this I know, that I would not trust thee among a flock of sheep."
Evil dispositions are shown early.

The Wolf and the Shepherds
A wolf looked into a hut and saw some shepherds comfortably regaling themselves on a joint of mutton. "A pretty row," said he, "would these men have made if they had caught me at such a supper!"
Men are too apt to condemn in others the very things that they practice themselves.

The Wolf and the Sheep
A wolf that had been bitten by a dog, and was in a very sad case, being unable to move, called to a Sheep that was passing by and begged her to fetch him some water from the neighboring stream. "For if you," said he, "will bring me a drink, I will find meat myself."
"Yes," said the Sheep, "I make no doubt of it; for, if I come near enough to give you the drink, you will soon make mince-meat of me."

The Wolf, the Fox, and the Ape
A wolf accused a fox of theft, but he entirely denied the charge. An ape undertook to judge the matter between them. When each had fully stated his case, the ape pronounced this sentence: "I do not think you, wolf, ever lost what you claim, and I do believe you, fox, to have stolen what you so stoutly deny."
The dishonest, if they act honestly, get no credit.

The Kid and the Wolf
A kid being high on the roof of a lofty house, and seeing a wolf pass below, began to revile him. The wolf merely stopped to reply; "Coward! It is not you who revile me, but the place on which you are standing."

The Wolf and the Lamb
As a wolf was lapping at the head of a running brook, he spied a stray lamb paddling, at some distance, down the stream. Having made up his mind to seize her, he thought to himself how he might justify his violence.
"Villain!" said he, running up to her; "how dare you muddle the water that I am drinking!"
"Indeed," said the lamb humbly, "I do not see how I can disturb the water, since it runs from you to me, not from me to you."
"Be that as it may," replied the wolf, "it was but a year ago that you called me many ill names."
"Oh, sir!" said the lamb, trembling, "a year ago I was not born."
"Well," replied the wolf, "if it was not you, it was your father, and that is all the same. But it is no use trying to argue me out of my supper." And without another word he fell upon the poor helpless lamb and tore her to pieces.

The Lamb and the Wolf
A lamb pursued by a wolf took refuge in a temple. Upon this the wolf called out to him and said that the priest would slay him if he caught him. "Be it so," said the lamb, "it is better to be sacrificed to God, than to be devoured by you."

The Wolf and the Goat
A wolf seeing a goat feeding on the edge of a high precipice where he could not come at her, besought her to come down lower, for fear she should miss her footing at that dizzy height. "Moreover," said he, "the grass is far sweeter and more abundant here below." But the Goat replied; "Excuse me; it is not for my dinner that you invite me, but for your own."

The Nurse and the Wolf
A wolf, roving about in search of food, passed by a door where a child was crying and its nurse scolding it. As he stood listening he heard the nurse say, "Now leave off crying this instant, or I'll throw you out to the wolf." So thinking that the old woman would be as good as her word, he waited quietly about the house, in expectation of a capital supper.
But as it grew dark and the child became quiet, he again heard the nurse, who was now fondling the child, say, "There's a good dear then; if the naughty wolf comes for my child, we'll beat him to death, we will."
The wolf, disappointed and mortified, thought it was now high time to be going home, and, hungry as a wolf indeed, muttered as he went along: "This comes of heeding people who say one thing and mean another!"

The Wolf and the Horse
As a wolf was roaming over a farm, he came to a field of oats Not being able to eat them, he left them and went his way. Presently meeting with a horse, he bade him come with him into the field; "For," says he, "I have found some capital oats, and I have not tasted one, but have kept them all for you, for the very sound of your teeth is music to my ear."
But the horse replied, "A pretty fellow! If wolves were able to eat oats, I suspect you would not have preferred your ears to your appetite."
Little thanks are due to him who only gives away what is of no use to himself.

The Wolves and the Sheep
Once upon a time, the wolves sent an embassy to the sheep, desiring that there might be peace between them for the time to come. "Why," said they, "should we be forever waging this deadly strife? Those wicked dogs are the cause of all; they are incessantly barking at us and provoking us. Send them away, and there will be no longer any obstacle to our eternal friendship and peace."
The silly sheep listened, the dogs were dismissed, and the flock, thus deprived of their best protectors, became an easy prey to their treacherous enemy.

The Wolf and the Shepherd
A wolf had long hung about a flock of sheep and had done them no harm. The shepherd, however, had his suspicions, and for a while was always on the lookout against him as an avowed enemy. But when the wolf continued for a long time following in the train of his flock without the least attempt to annoy them, he began to look upon him more as a friend than a foe. Having occasion to go into the city one day, he entrusted the sheep to his care.
The wolf no sooner saw his opportunity than he immediately fell upon the sheep and worried them. The shepherd, on his return, seeing his flock destroyed, exclaimed, "Fool that I am! Yet I deserved no less for trusting my sheep with a wolf!"
There is more danger from a pretended friend than from an open enemy.

The Lamb and the Wolf
A lamb pursued by a wolf took refuge in a temple. Upon this the wolf called out to him and said that the priest would slay him if he caught him. "Be it so," said the lamb, "it is better to be sacrificed to God, than to be devoured by you."

The Stag, the Wolf, and the Sheep
A stag asked a sheep to lend him a measure of wheat and said that the wolf would be his surety. The sheep, fearing some fraud was intended, excused herself, saying; "The wolf is accustomed to seize what he wants and to run off and you, too, can quickly outstrip me in your rapid flight. How then shall I be able to find either of you when the day of payment comes?"

The silly sheep listened, the dogs were dismissed, and the flock, thus deprived of their best protectors, became an easy prey to their treacherous enemy.

The Boy Who Cried Wolf
A shepherd boy, who tended his flock not far from a village, used to amuse himself at times in crying out "Wolf! Wolf!" Twice or thrice his trick succeeded; the whole village came running out to his assistance, when all the return they got was to be laughed at for their pains.
At last one day the wolf came indeed. The boy cried out in earnest. His neighbors, supposing him to be at his old sport, paid no heed to his cries, and the wolf devoured the sheep. So the boy learned, when it was too late, that liars are not believed even when they tell the truth.

The Porker and the Sheep
A young porker took up his quarters in a fold of sheep. One day the shepherd laid hold of him, so he squeaked and struggled with all his might and main. The sheep reproached him for crying out and said, "The master often lays hold of us, and we do not cry."
"Yes," replied he, "but our cases are not the same, for he catches you for the sake of your wool, but me for my fry."

The Lion and His Three Councilors
The lion called the sheep to ask her if his breath smelled. She said Aye, so he bit off her head for a fool. He called the wolf and asked him. He said No, so he tore him in pieces for a flatterer. At last he called the fox and asked him. Truly he had got a cold, and could not smell.

The Wolf, having shown himself an apt pupil, said to the Shepherd; "Since you have taught me to steal, you must keep a sharp look-out, or you will lose some of your own flock."

The Lion and the Cow, the Goat and the Sheep
The cow, the goat, and the sheep went hunting in the chase with a lion and they captured a deer. When it came time to part ways and share in their catch, the lion said to them, "My lords, I let you know that the first part is mine, because I am your lord; the second because I am stronger than you; the third because I ran more swift than you did; and whosoever touches the fourth part, he shall be my mortal enemy!"
And thus the lion took for himself alone the deer.

The Crow and the Sheep
A troublesome crow seated herself on the back of a sheep. The sheep, much against his will, carried her backward and forward for a long time and at last said: "If you had treated a dog in this way, you would have had your deserts from his sharp teeth." To this the crow replied; "I despise the weak and yield to the strong. I know whom I may bully and whom I must flatter, and thus I hope to prolong my life to a good old age."

The Wolf and the Sheep
A wolf that had been bitten by a dog, and was in a very sad case, being unable to move, called to a Sheep that was passing by and begged her to fetch him some water from the neighboring stream. "For if you," said he, "will bring me a drink, I will find meat myself."
"Yes," said the Sheep, "I make no doubt of it; for, if I come near enough to give you the drink, you will soon make mince-meat of me."

As a wolf was lapping at the head of a running brook, he spied a stray lamb paddling, at some distance, down the stream. Having made up his mind to seize her, he thought to himself how he might justify his violence.

"Indeed," said the lamb humbly, "I do not see how I can disturb the water, since it runs from you to me, not from me to you."
"Be that as it may," replied the wolf, "it was but a year ago that you called me many ill names."
"Oh, sir!" said the lamb, trembling, "a year ago I was not born."
"Well," replied the wolf, "if it was not you, it was your father, and that is all the same. But it is no use trying to argue me out of my supper." And without another word he fell upon the poor helpless lamb and tore her to pieces.

The Wolf in Sheep's Clothing
A wolf, once upon a time, resolved to disguise himself, thinking that he should thus gain an easier livelihood. Having, therefore, clothed himself in a sheep's skin, he contrived to get among a flock of sheep and feed along with them, so that even the shepherd was deceived by the imposture.
When night came on and the fold was closed, the wolf was shut up with the sheep and the door made fast. But the shepherd, wanting something for his supper, and going in to fetch out a sheep, mistook the wolf for one of them and killed him on the spot.

The Dog and His Master
A certain man was setting out on a journey when, seeing his dog standing at the door, he cried out to him, "What are you gaping about? Get ready to come with me." The dog, wagging his tail, said, "I am all right, master; it is you who have to pack up."

The Dogs and the Hides
Some hungry dogs, seeing some rawhides that a skinner had left in the bottom of a stream, and not being able to reach them, agreed among themselves to drink up the river to get at the prize. So they set to work, but they all burst themselves with drinking before ever they came near the hides.
Those who aim at a goal by unreasonable means are likely to ruin themselves in the attempt.

The Monkey and the Dolphin
It was an old custom among sailors to carry about with them little Maltese lap dogs, or monkeys, to amuse them on the voyage. So it happened once upon a time that a man took with him a monkey as a companion on board ship.
While they were off Sunium, the famous headland of Attica, the ship was caught in a violent storm and, being capsized, all on board were thrown in the water and had to swim for land as best they could. Among them was the monkey.
A dolphin saw the monkey struggling and, taking him for a man, went to his assistance and bore him on his back straight for shore. When they had just got opposite Piraeus, the harbor of Athens, the dolphin asked the monkey if he were an Athenian.
"Yes," answered the monkey, "assuredly, and of one of the first families in the place."
"Then, of course, you know Piraeus," said the dolphin.
"Oh, yes," said the Monkey, who thought it was the name of some distinguished citizen, "he is one of my most intimate friends."
Indignant at so gross a deceit and falsehood, the dolphin dived to the bottom, and left the lying monkey to his fate.

The Dog, the Cock, and the Fox
A dog and a cock having struck up an acquaintance went out on their travels together. Nightfall found them in a forest, so the cock, flying up on a tree, perched among the branches, while the dog dozed below at the foot. As the night passed away and the day dawned, the cock, according to his custom, set up a shrill crowing.
A fox, hearing him and thinking to make a meal of him, came and stood under the tree and thus addressed him: "Thou art a good little bird and most useful to thy fellow creatures. Come down, then, that we may sing and rejoice together."
The cock replied; "Go, my good friend, to the foot of the tree, and call the church elders to toll the bell." But as the Fox went to call them, the cog jumped out in a moment, seized the fox, and made an end of him.
They who lay traps for others are often caught by their own bait.

The Dogs and the Fox
Some dogs found the skin of a lion and began to tear it to pieces with their teeth. A fox, seeing them, said; "If this lion were alive, you would soon find out that his claws were stronger than your teeth."
It is easy to kick a man that is down.

The House Dog and the Wolf
A lean, hungry wolf chanced one moonlit night to fall in with a plump, well-fed house dog. After the first compliments were passed between them, "How is it, my friend," said the wolf, "that you look so sleek? How well your food agrees with you! And here am I striving for my living night and day and can hardly save myself from starving."
"Well," says the dog, "if you would fare like me, you have only to do as I do." "Indeed!" says he, "and what is that?" "Why," replied the dog, "just to guard the master's house and keep off the thieves at night." "With all my heart; for at present I have but a sorry time of it. This woodland life, with its frosts and rains, is sharp work for me. To have a warm roof over my head and a bellyful of victuals always at hand will, I think, not be a bad exchange." "True," said the dog; "therefore you have nothing to do but to follow me."
Now as they were jogging on together, the wolf spied a mark in the dog's neck, and having a strange curiosity, could not resist asking what it meant. "Pooh! Nothing at all," says the dog. "No, tell me" said the wolf. "Oh! A mere trifle, perhaps the collar to which my chain is fastened."
"Chain!" cried the wolf in surprise; "you don't mean that you cannot rove when and where you please?" "Why, not exactly perhaps; you see I am looked upon as rather fierce, so they sometimes tie me up in the daytime, but I assure you I have perfect liberty at night. The master feeds me off his own plate and the servants give me their tidbits. I am such a favorite, so what is the matter? Where are you going?"
"Oh, good night to you," said the wolf; "you are welcome to your dainties; but for me, a dry crust with liberty against a king's luxury with a chain."

The Dog Invited to Supper
A gentleman, having prepared a great feast, invited a friend to supper. The gentleman's dog, upon meeting the friend's dog, said, "Come, my good fellow, and sup with us tonight."
The dog was delighted with the invitation, and as he stood by and saw the preparation for the feast, he said to himself, "Capital fare indeed! This is, in truth, good luck. I shall revel in dainties, and I will take good care to lay in an ample stock tonight, for I may have nothing to eat tomorrow."
As he said this to himself, he wagged his tail and gave a sly look at his friend who had invited him. But his tail wagging to and fro caught the cook's eye, who seeing a stranger, straightway seized him by the legs and threw him out of the window.
When the dog reached the ground, he set off yelping down the street, upon which the neighbors' dogs ran up to him, and asked him how he liked his supper. With a sorry smile he said, "I hardly know, for we drank so deep that I can't even tell you which way I got out of the house."
They who enter by the back stairs may expect to be shown out at the window.

The Thief and the Dog
A thief coming to rob a house would have stopped the barking of a dog by throwing bread to him. "Away with you!" said the dog. "I had my suspicions of you before, but this excess of civility assures me that you are a rogue."
A bribe in hand betrays mischief at heart.

The Hare and the Hound
A hound having put up a hare from a bush, chased her for some distance, but the hare had the best of it, and got off. A goatherd who was coming by jeered at the hound, saying that puss was the better runner of the two. "You forget," replied the hound, "that it is one thing to be running for your dinner and another for your life."

The Old Hound
A hound, who had been excellent in his time and had done good service to his master in the field, at length became worn out with the weight of years and trouble. One day, when hunting a wild boar, he seized the creature by the ear, but his teeth gave way. He was forced to let go his hold and the boar escaped. Upon this the huntsman, coming up, severely rated him. The feeble dog replied, "Spare your old servant! It was the power, not the will that failed me. Remember what I was, rather than abuse me for what I am."

The Man, the Horse, the Ox, and the Dog
A horse, ox, and dog, driven to great straits by the cold, sought shelter and protection from a man. He received them kindly, lighted a fire, and warmed them. He allowed the horse to eat of his oats, gave the ox an abundance of hay, and fed the dog with meat from his own table.
Grateful for these favors, they determined to repay him to the best of their ability. They divided for this purpose the term of his life between them, and each endowed one portion of it with the qualities that chiefly characterized himself.
The horse chose the man's earliest years and endowed them with his own attributes. Hence every man is in youth impetuous, headstrong, and obstinate in maintaining his own opinion.
The ox took under his patronage the next term of life, and therefore man in his middle age is fond of work, devoted to labor, and resolute to amass wealth and to husband his resources.
The end of life was reserved to the dog, wherefore the old man is often snappish, irritable, hard to please, and selfish, tolerant only of his own household, but averse to strangers and to all who do not administer to his comfort or to his necessities.

The Dog and the Shadow
A dog had stolen a piece of meat out of a butcher's shop and was crossing a river on his way home, when he saw his own shadow reflected in the stream below. Thinking that it was another dog with another piece of meat, he resolved to make himself master of that also. But in snapping at the supposed treasure, he dropped the bit he was carrying, and so lost all.

The Mischievous Dog
There was a dog so wild and mischievous that his master was obliged to fasten a heavy bell about his neck to prevent him biting and worrying his neighbors. The dog, priding himself upon his badge, paraded in the marketplace, shaking his bell to attract attention.
A sly friend whispered to him; "The less noise you make, the better. Your mark of distinction is no reward of merit, but a badge of disgrace!"
Men often mistake notoriety for fame and would rather be remarked for their vices or follies than not be noticed at all.

The Farmer and the Dogs
A farmer, during a severe winter, being shut up by the snow in his farmhouse, and sharply pressed for food, which he was unable to get out to procure, began consuming his own sheep. As the hard weather continued, he next ate up his goats. And at last?for there was no break in the weather?he began to eat the oxen.
Upon this, the dogs said to one another, "Let us be off, for since the master, as we see, has had no pity on the working oxen, how is it likely he will spare us?"
When our neighbor's house is on fire, it is time to look to our own.

The Brazier and His Dog
There was a certain brazier who had a little dog. While he hammered away at his metal, the dog slept, but whenever he sat down to his dinner the dog woke up. "Sluggard cur!" said the brazier, throwing him a bone, "you sleep through the noise of the anvil, but wake up at the first clatter of my teeth."
Men are awake enough to their own interests, who turn a deaf ear to their friends' distress.

The Two Dogs
A man had two dogs; a hound, trained to assist him in his sports, and a housedog, taught to watch the house. When he returned home after a good day's sport, he always gave the housedog a good share of his spoil.
The hound, feeling much aggrieved at this, reproached his companion, saying; "It is very hard to have all this labor, while you, who do not assist in the chase, live on the fruits of my exertions." The housedog replied; "Do not blame me, my friend, but find fault with the master, who has not taught me to labor, but to depend for subsistence on the labor of others."
Children are not to be blamed for the faults of their parents.

The Ass and the Lap Dog
There were an ass and a lap dog who belonged to the same master. The ass was tied up in the stable, had plenty of corn and hay to eat, and was as well off as an ass could be. The little dog was always sporting and gamboling about, caressing and fawning upon his master in a thousand amusing ways, so that he became a great favorite, and was permitted to lie in his master's lap.
The ass, indeed, had enough to do; he was drawing wood all day and had to take his turn at the mill at night. But while he grieved over his own lot, it galled him more to see the lap dog living in such ease and luxury.
Thinking that if he acted a like part to his master, he should fare the same, he broke one day from his halter and, rushing into the hall, began to kick and prance about in the strangest fashion. Swishing his tail and mimicking the frolics of the favorite, he upset the table where his master was at dinner, breaking it in two and smashing all the crockery. Nor would he stop until he jumped upon his master and pawed him with his rough-shod feet.
The servants, seeing their master in no little danger, thought it was now high time to interfere. Having released him from the ass' caresses, they so belabored the silly creature with sticks and staves that he never got up again. As he breathed his last, he exclaimed, "Why could not I have been satisfied with my natural position, without attempting, by tricks and grimaces, to imitate one who was but a puppy after all!"

The Dog's House
In the wintertime, a dog rolled himself together and coiled up in as small a space as possible. On account of the cold, he determined to make himself a house. When the summer returned again he lay asleep, stretched at his full length and appeared to himself to be of a great size. He concluded that it would be neither an easy nor a necessary work to make himself such a house as would accommodate him.

The Dog in the Manger
A dog made his bed in a manger, and laid snarling and growling to keep the horses from their feed. "See," said one of them, "what a miserable cur! Who neither can eat corn himself, nor will allow those to eat it who can."

The Man Bitten By a Dog
A man, who had been bitten by a dog, was going about asking who could cure him. One that met him said, "Sir, if you would be cured, take a bit of bread and dip it in the blood of the wound, and give it to the dog that bit you." The man smiled and said, "If I were to follow your advice, I should be bitten by all the dogs in the city."
He who proclaims himself ready to buy up his enemies will never want for a supply of them.

The Fox and the Grapes
One afternoon a fox was walking through the forest and spotted a bunch of grapes hanging from over a lofty branch. "Just the thing to quench my thirst," said he.
Taking a few steps back, the fox jumped and just missed the hanging grapes. Again the fox took a few steps back, ran, jumped, and tried to reach them but still failed.
Finally giving up, the fox turned up his nose and said, "They're probably sour anyway," and proceeded to walk away.
It is easy to despise what you cannot have.

The Ass, the Fox, and the Lion
An ass and a fox, having made a compact alliance, went out into the fields to hunt. They met a lion on the way. The fox, seeing the danger, made up to the lion and whispered that he would betray the ass into his power if he would promise to bear him harmless. The lion agreed and the Fox contrived to lead the ass into a snare. The lion no sooner saw the ass secured than he fell at once upon the fox, reserving the other for his next meal.

The Dog, the Cock, and the Fox
A dog and a cock having struck up an acquaintance went out on their travels together. Nightfall found them in a forest, so the cock, flying up on a tree, perched among the branches, while the dog dozed below at the foot. As the night passed away and the day dawned, the cock, according to his custom, set up a shrill crowing.
A fox, hearing him and thinking to make a meal of him, came and stood under the tree and thus addressed him: "Thou art a good little bird and most useful to thy fellow creatures. Come down, then, that we may sing and rejoice together."
The cock replied; "Go, my good friend, to the foot of the tree, and call the church elders to toll the bell." But as the Fox went to call them, the cog jumped out in a moment, seized the fox, and made an end of him.
They who lay traps for others are often caught by their own bait.

The Lion, the Mouse, and the Fox
A lion, fatigued by the heat of a summer's day, fell fast asleep in his den. A mouse ran over his mane and ears and woke him from his slumbers. He rose up and shook himself in great wrath and searched every corner of his den to find the mouse. A fox, seeing him, said, "A fine lion you are, to be frightened of a mouse." "'Tis not the mouse I fear," said the lion. "I resent his familiarity and ill-breeding."
Little liberties are great offences.

The Fox and the Thorn Bush
A fox, to escape the peril of the chase, leapt into a thorn bush, whose thorns hurt him sore. Thereupon the fox, weeping in his anguish, said to the thorn bush, "I am come to thee as to my refuge, and thou hast hurt me to the death." Then the thorn bush said to the fox, "Thou hast erred, and well thou hast beguiled thyself, for thou thought to have taken me as thou art accustomed to taking chickens and hens."

The Fox and the Goat
A fox had fallen into a well and had been casting about for a long time how he should get out again. At length a goat came to the place and, wanting to drink, asked the fox whether the water was good and if there was plenty of it. The fox, avoiding the real danger of his case, replied, "Come down, my friend; the water is so good that I cannot drink enough of it, and so abundant that it cannot be exhausted."
Upon this the goat without any more ado leaped in. The fox, taking advantage of his friend's horns, nimbly leaped out and coolly remarked to the poor deluded goat; "If you had half as much brains as you have beard, you would have looked before you leaped."
Look before you leap.

The Fox and the Lion
A fox saw a lion confined in a cage and, standing near him, bitterly reviled him. The lion said to the fox; "It is not thou who revilest me; but this mischance which has befallen me."

The Dogs and the Fox
Some dogs found the skin of a lion and began to tear it to pieces with their teeth. A fox, seeing them, said; "If this lion were alive, you would soon find out that his claws were stronger than your teeth."
It is easy to kick a man that is down.

The Lion and His Three Councilors
The lion called the sheep to ask her if his breath smelled. She said Aye, so he bit off her head for a fool. He called the wolf and asked him. He said No, so he tore him in pieces for a flatterer. At last he called the fox and asked him. Truly he had got a cold, and could not smell.
Wise men say nothing in dangerous times.

The Fox and the Mask
A fox had stolen into the house of an actor and, in rummaging among his various properties, laid hold of a highly finished mask. "A fine-looking head, indeed!" cried he. "What a pity it is that it has no brains!"
A fair outside is but a poor substitute for inward worth.

The Fox without a Tail
A fox being caught in a trap was glad to save his neck by leaving his tail behind him. Upon coming abroad into the world, he began to be so sensible of the disgrace such a defect would bring upon him, that he almost wished he had died rather than come away without it.
Resolving to make the best of a bad matter, he called a meeting of the rest of the foxes and proposed that all should follow his example. "You have no notion," said he, "of the ease and comfort with which I now move about: I could never have believed it if I had not tried it myself. But really, when one comes to reason upon it, a tail is such an ugly, inconvenient, unnecessary appendage, that the only wonder is that, as foxes, we could have put up with it so long. I propose, therefore, my worthy brethren, that you all profit by the experience that I am most willing to afford you and that all foxes from this day forward cut off their tails."
Upon this one of the oldest stepped forward and said, "I rather think, my friend, that you would not have advised us to part with our tails, if there were any chance of recovering your own."

The Lion and the Fox
A fox agreed to wait upon a lion in the capacity of a servant. Each for a time performed the part belonging to his station; the fox used to point out the prey, and the lion fell upon it and seized it. But the fox, beginning to think himself as good a beast as his master, begged to be allowed to hunt the game instead of finding it. His request was granted, but as he was in the act of making a descent upon a herd, the huntsmen came out upon him, and he was himself made the prize.

The Fox and the Cock
A fox came toward a cock and said to him, "I would like know if you can sing as well as your father did." The cock shut his eyes and began to cry and sing and the fox took and carried him away. The people of the town started crying, "The fox is getting away with the cock!"
The cock then said to the fox, "My lord, don't you understand what the people are saying, that you are taking their cock? Tell them that it is your cock and not theirs." As the fox said, "It is not yours, but it is mine," the cock escaped from the fox's mouth and flew up a tree.
Then the cock said to the fox, "You lied, for I am theirs and not yours." The fox began to hit the earth with his mouth and head, saying, "Mouth, you have spoken too much! You should have eaten the cock had not your words been too many."
Much talking causes harm and too much crowing causes hurt.

The Fox and the Crow
A crow had snatched a goodly piece of cheese out of a window, and flew with it into a high tree, intent to enjoy her prize. A fox spied the dainty morsel and thus planned his approaches.
"Oh crow," said he, "how beautiful are thy wings, how bright thine eye! How graceful thy neck! Thy breast is the breast of an eagle! Thy claws?I beg pardon?thy talons, are a match for all the beasts of the field. Oh! That such a bird should be dumb, and want only a voice!"
The crow, pleased with the flattery and chuckling to think how she would surprise the fox with her caw, opened her mouth. Down dropped the cheese! The fox snapping up observed, as he walked away, that ?whatever he had remarked of her beauty, he had said nothing yet of her brains.?
Men seldom flatter without some private end in view, and they who listen to such music may expect to have to pay the piper.

The Fox and the Monkey
A fox and a monkey were traveling together on the same road. As they journeyed, they passed through a cemetery full of monuments. "All these monuments which you see," said the monkey, "are erected in honor of my ancestors, who were in their day freedmen, and citizens of great renown."
The fox replied; "You have chosen a most appropriate subject for your falsehoods, as I am sure none of your ancestors will be able to contradict you."
A false tale often betrays itself.

The Wild Boar and the Fox
A wild boar was whetting his tusks against a tree when a fox came by and asked why he did so. "For," said he, "I see no reason for it; there is neither hunter nor hound in sight, nor any other danger that I can see at hand." "True," replied the boar, "but when that danger does arise, I shall have something else to do than to sharpen my weapons."
It is too late to whet the sword when the trumpet sounds to draw it.

The Eagle and the Fox
An eagle and a fox had long lived together as good neighbors; the eagle at the summit of a high tree, the fox in a hole at the foot of it. One day, however, while the fox was abroad, the eagle made a swoop at the fox's cub and carried it off to her nest, thinking that her lofty dwelling would secure her from the fox's revenge.
The fox, on her return home, upbraided the eagle for this breach of friendship, and begged earnestly to have her young one again. Finding that her entreaties were of no avail, she snatched a torch from an altar-fire that had been lighted hard. Involving the whole tree in flame and smoke, she soon made the eagle restore, through fear for herself and her own young ones, the cub that she had just now denied to her most earnest prayers.
The tyrant, though he may despise the tears of the oppressed, is never safe from their vengeance.

The Fox and the Lion
A fox that had never seen a lion, when by chance he met him for the first time, was so terrified that he almost died of fright. When he met him the second time, he was still afraid, but managed to disguise his fear. When he saw him the third time, he was so much emboldened that he went up to him and asked him how he did.
Familiarity breeds contempt.

The Quack Frog
A frog emerging from the mud of a swamp proclaimed to all the world that he was come to cure all diseases. "Here!" he cried, "come and see a doctor, the proprietor of medicines such as man never heard of before; no, not, Aesculapius himself, Jove's court-physician!"
"And how," said the fox, "dare you set up to heal others, who are not able to cure your own limping gait and blotched and wrinkled skin?"
Test a man's professions by his practice.

The Farmer and the Fox
A farmer, having a long grievance against a fox for robbing his poultry yard, caught him at last. Being determined to take full revenge, he tied some towel soaked in oil to his tail, and set it on fire. The fox by a strange fatality, rushed through the fields of the farmer. It was the time of the wheat harvest; and the flames destroyed all. The farmer reaped nothing that year.

The Fox and the Stork
A fox one day invited a stork to dinner, and being disposed to divert himself at the expense of his guest, provided nothing for the entertainment but some thin soup in a shallow dish. This the fox lapped up very readily, while the stork, unable to gain a mouthful with her long narrow bill, was as hungry at the end of dinner as when she began. The fox meanwhile professed his regret at seeing her eat so sparingly and feared that the dish was not seasoned to her mind.
The stork said little, but begged that the fox would do her the honor of returning her visit. Accordingly he agreed to dine with her on the following day. He arrived true to his appointment and the dinner was ordered forthwith.
When the meal was served up, the fox found to his dismay that it was contained in a narrow-necked vessel, down which the stork readily thrust her long neck and bill, while he was obliged to content himself with licking the neck of the jar. Unable to satisfy his hunger, he retired with as good a grace as he could, observing that he could hardly find fault with his entertainer, who had only paid him back in his own coin.

The Lion, the Ass, and the Fox
The lion, the ass, and the fox formed a party to go out hunting. They took a large booty and, when the sport was ended, thought to have a hearty meal.
The lion bade the ass to share the spoil. So, dividing it into three equal parts, the ass begged his friends to make their choice. The lion, in great indignation, fell upon the ass and tore him to pieces.
The lion then bade the fox to make a division. Gathering the whole into one great heap, the fox reserved but the smallest mite for himself. "Ah, friend," said the lion, "who taught you to make so equitable a division?" "I wanted no other lesson," replied the fox, "than the ass' fate."
Better be wise by the misfortunes of others than by your own.

The Fox and the Woodsman
A fox, hard pressed by the hounds after a long run, came up to a man who was cutting wood, and begged him to afford him some place where he might hide himself. The man showed him his own hut and the fox, creeping in, hid himself in a corner.
The hunters presently came up, and asking the man whether he had seen the fox, "No," said he, but pointed with his finger to the corner. They, however, not understanding the hint, were off again immediately.
When the fox perceived that they were out of sight, he was stealing off without saying a word. But the man upbraided him, saying, "Is this the way you take leave of your host, without a word of thanks for your safety?"
"A pretty host!" said the fox, turning round upon him. "If you had been as honest with your fingers as you were with your tongue, I should not have left your roof without bidding you farewell."

The Leopard and the Fox
A leopard and a fox had a contest about who was the finer creature of the two. The leopard put forward the beauty of its numberless spots, but the fox replied, "It is better to have a versatile mind than a variegated body."

The Wolf, the Fox, and the Ape
A wolf accused a fox of theft, but he entirely denied the charge. An ape undertook to judge the matter between them. When each had fully stated his case, the ape pronounced this sentence: "I do not think you, wolf, ever lost what you claim, and I do believe you, fox, to have stolen what you so stoutly deny."
The dishonest, if they act honestly, get no credit.

The Sick Lion
A lion, no longer able from the weakness of old age to hunt for his prey, laid himself up in his den. Breathing with great difficulty and speaking with a low voice, the lion gave out that he was very ill indeed. The report soon spread among the beasts and there was great lamentation for the sick lion. One after the other came to see him. Catching him thus alone, and in his own den, the lion made an easy prey of them and grew fat upon his diet.
The fox, suspecting the truth of the matter, came at length to make his visit of inquiry and, standing at some distance, asked his Majesty how he did. "Ah, my dearest friend," said the lion, "is it you? Why do you stand so far from me? Come, sweet friend, and pour a word of consolation in the poor lion's ear, who has but a short time to live."
"Bless you!" said the fox, "but excuse me if I cannot stay. For, to tell the truth, I feel quite uneasy at the mark of the footsteps that I see here, all pointing towards your den, and none returning outwards."
Affairs are easier of entrance than of exit and it is but common prudence to see our way out before we venture in.

The Lion, the Bear, and the Fox
A lion and a bear found the carcass of a fawn and had a long fight for it. The contest was so hard and even that, at last, both of them, half-blinded and half-dead, lay panting on the ground, without strength to touch the prize that was stretched between them. A fox coming by at the time, and seeing their helpless condition, stepped in between the combatants and carried off the booty.
"Poor creatures that we are," cried they, "who have been exhausting all our strength and injuring one another, merely to give a rogue a dinner!"

The Fox and the Hedgehog
A fox, while crossing over a river, was driven by a stream into a narrow gorge and laid there for a long time unable to get out, covered with myriads of horse-flies that had fastened themselves upon him. A hedgehog, who was wandering in that direction saw him and, taking compassion on him, asked him if he should drive away the flies that were so tormenting him. But the fox begged him to do nothing of the sort.
"Why not?" asked the hedgehog. "Because," replied the fox, "these flies that are upon me now, are already full and draw but little blood. But should you remove them, a swarm of fresh and hungry ones will come, who will not leave a drop of blood in my body."

The Rivers and the Sea
Once upon a time the rivers combined against the sea and, going in a body, accused her, saying; "Why is it that when we rivers pour our waters into you so fresh and sweet, you straightway render them salty and unpalatable?" The sea, observing the temper in which they came, merely answered; "If you do not wish to become salty, please to keep away from me altogether."
Those who are most benefited are often the first to complain.

The Marriage of the Sun
Once upon a time, in a very warm summer, it was reported that the sun was going to be married. All the birds and beasts were delighted at the thought. The frogs, above all others, were determined to have a good holiday. But an old toad put a stop to their festivities by observing that it was an occasion for sorrow rather than for joy. "For if," said he, "the sun of himself now parches up the marshes so that we can hardly bear it, what will become of us if he should have half a dozen little suns in addition?"

The Moon and Her Mother
The moon once asked her mother to make her a little cloak that would fit her well. "How," replied she, "can I make you a cloak to fit you, who are now a new moon, and then a full moon, and then again neither one nor the other?"

The Husbandman and the Sea
A husbandman seeing a ship full of sailors tossed about up and down upon the billows, cried out; "O Sea! Deceitful and pitiless element, that destroys all who venture upon thee!"
The sea heard him and, assuming a woman's voice, replied, "Do not reproach me; I am not the cause of this disturbance, but the winds, that when they fall upon me will give no repose. But should you sail over me when they are away, you will say that I am milder and more tractable than your own mother earth."

The Wind and the Sun
A dispute once arose between the wind and the sun, which was the stronger of the two, and they agreed to put the point upon this issue, that whichever soonest made a traveler take off his cloak should be accounted the more powerful.
The Wind began, and blew with all his might and main a blast, cold and fierce as a Thracian storm; but the stronger he blew the closer the traveler wrapped his cloak around him, and the tighter he grasped it with his hands.
Then broke out the Sun. With his welcome beams he dispersed the vapor and the cold; the traveler felt the genial warmth, and as the Sun shone brighter and brighter, he sat down, overcome with the heat, and cast his cloak on the ground.
Thus the Sun was declared the conqueror, and it has ever been deemed that persuasion is better than force; and that the sunshine of a kind and gentle manner will sooner lay open a poor man's heart than all the threatening and force of blustering authority.

The Frog and the Ox
An ox, grazing in a swampy meadow, chanced to set his foot among a parcel of young frogs and crushed nearly the whole brood to death. One that escaped ran off to his mother with the dreadful news; "And, O mother!" said he, "it was a big four-footed beast that did it!"
"Big?" quote the old frog. "How big? Was it as big"?and she puffed herself out to a great degree?"as big as that?" "Oh!" said the little one, "a great deal bigger than that." "Well, was it so big?" and she swelled herself out yet more.
"Indeed, mother, but it was; if you were to burst yourself, you would never reach half its size." Provoked at such a disparagement of her powers, the old frog made one more trial, and burst herself indeed.
Men are ruined by attempting a greatness to which they have no claim.

The Boys and the Frogs
A troop of boys were playing at the edge of a pond when, perceiving a number of frogs in the water, they began to pelt them with stones. They had already killed many of the poor creatures, when one more hardy than the rest put his head above the water and cried out to them, "Stop your cruel sport, my lads! Consider what is play to you is death to us."

The Quack Frog
A frog emerging from the mud of a swamp proclaimed to all the world that he was come to cure all diseases. "Here!" he cried, "come and see a doctor, the proprietor of medicines such as man never heard of before; no, not, Aesculapius himself, Jove's court-physician!"
"And how," said the fox, "dare you set up to heal others, who are not able to cure your own limping gait and blotched and wrinkled skin?"
Test a man's professions by his practice.

The Two Frogs
Two frogs were neighbors. One lived in a deep pond, far removed from public view; the other lived in a gully containing little water, and crossed by a country road. He that lived in the pond warned his friend, and entreated him to change his residence and to come and live with him, saying that he would enjoy greater safety from danger and more abundant food. The other refused, saying that he felt it very hard to remove from a place to which he had become so accustomed. A few days afterwards a heavy wagon passed through the gully, and crushed him to death under its wheels
The Ass and the Frogs
An ass, carrying a load of wood, passed through a pond. As he was crossing through the water he lost his footing, stumbled, and fell. Not being able to rise on account of his load, he groaned heavily.
Some frogs frequenting the pool heard his lamentation and said; "What would you do if you had to live here always as we do, when you make a fuss about a mere fall into the water?"
Men often bear little grievances with less courage than they do large misfortunes.

The Frogs Asking for a King
In the days of old, when the frogs were all at liberty in the lakes and had grown quite weary of following every one his own devices, they assembled one day together. With no little clamor they petitioned Jupiter to let them have a king to keep them in better order and make them lead more honest lives.
Jupiter, knowing the vanity of their hearts, smiled at their request, and threw down a log into the lake, which by the splash and commotion it made, sent the whole commonwealth into the greatest terror and amazement. They rushed under the water and into the mud, and dared not come within ten leaps' length of the spot where it lay.
At length one frog, bolder than the rest, ventured to pop his head above the water and take a survey of their new king at a respectful distance. Presently, when they perceived the log lie stock-still, others began to swim up to it and around it. By degrees, growing bolder and bolder, they at last leaped upon it and treated it with the greatest contempt.
Dissatisfied with so tame a ruler, they forthwith petitioned Jupiter a second time for another and more active king, upon which he sent them a stork. It no sooner arrived among them than he began laying hold of them and devouring them one by one as fast as he could, and it was in vain that they endeavored to escape him.
Then they sent Mercury with a private message to Jupiter, beseeching him that he would take pity on them once more; but Jupiter replied that they were only suffering the punishment due to their folly, and that another time they would learn to let well alone, and not be dissatisfied with their natural condition.

The Two Frogs
Two frogs dwelt in the same pool. The pool being dried up under the summer's heat, they left it, and set out together to seek another home. As they went along they chanced to pass a deep well, amply supplied with water. One of the frogs said to the other, "Let us descend and make our abode in this well; it will furnish us with shelter and food." The other replied with greater caution; "But suppose the water should fail us, how can we get out again from so great a depth?"
Do nothing without a regard to the consequences.

The Hares and the Frogs
Once upon a time the hares, driven desperate by the many enemies that compassed them about on every side, came to the sad resolution that there was nothing left for them but to make away with themselves, one and all. Off they scudded to a nearby lake, determined to drown themselves as the most miserable of creatures.
A shoal of frogs seated upon the bank, frightened at the approach of the hares, leaped in the greatest alarm and confusion into the water. "Nay, then, my friends," said a hare that was foremost, "our case is not so desperate yet, for here are other poor creatures more faint-hearted than ourselves."

The Monkey and the Camel
At a great meeting of the beasts, the monkey stood up to dance. Having greatly distinguished himself, and being applauded by all present, it moved the spleen of the camel, who came forward and began to dance also. But he made himself so utterly absurd, that all the beasts in indignation set upon him with clubs and drove him out of the ring.

The Monkeys and Their Mother
The monkey, it is said, has two young ones at a birth. The mother fondles one and nurses it with the greatest affection and care, but hates and neglects the other. It happened once on a time that the young one that was caressed and loved was smothered by the too great affection of the mother, while the despised one grew up in spite of the neglect to which it was exposed.
The best intentions will not always ensure success.

Jupiter and the Monkey
Jupiter issued a proclamation to all the beasts of the forest and promised a royal reward to the one whose offspring should be deemed the handsomest. The monkey came with the rest, and presented, with all a mother's tenderness, a flat-nosed, hairless, ill-featured young monkey as a candidate for the promised reward. A general laugh saluted her on the presentation of her son. But she resolutely said; "I know not whether Jupiter will allot the prize to my son; but this I do know, that he is at least in the eyes of me, his mother, the dearest, handsomest, and most beautiful of all."

The Dancing Monkeys
A prince had some monkeys trained to dance. Being naturally great mimics of men's actions, they showed themselves most apt pupils. When arrayed in their rich clothes and masks, they danced as well as any of the courtiers. The spectacle was often repeated with great applause, till on one occasion a courtier, bent on mischief, took from his pocket a handful of nuts, and threw them upon the stage.
The monkeys, at the sight of the nuts, forgot their dancing and became as indeed they were?monkeys instead of actors. Pulling off their masks and tearing their robes, they fought with one another for the nuts. The dancing spectacle thus came to an end, amidst the laughter and ridicule of the audience.

The Monkey and the Fishermen
A monkey was sitting up in a high tree when, seeing some fishermen laying their nets in a river, he watched what they were doing. The men had no sooner set their nets and retired a short distance to their dinner, than the monkey came down from the tree, thinking that he would try his hand at the same sport. But in attempting to lay the nets he got so entangled in them, that being well-nigh choked, he was forced to exclaim; "This serves me right; for what business had I, who know nothing of fishing, to meddle with such tackle as this?"

The Monkey and the Dolphin
It was an old custom among sailors to carry about with them little Maltese lap dogs, or monkeys, to amuse them on the voyage. So it happened once upon a time that a man took with him a monkey as a companion on board ship.
While they were off Sunium, the famous headland of Attica, the ship was caught in a violent storm and, being capsized, all on board were thrown in the water and had to swim for land as best they could. Among them was the monkey.
A dolphin saw the monkey struggling and, taking him for a man, went to his assistance and bore him on his back straight for shore. When they had just got opposite Piraeus, the harbor of Athens, the dolphin asked the monkey if he were an Athenian.
"Yes," answered the monkey, "assuredly, and of one of the first families in the place."
"Then, of course, you know Piraeus," said the dolphin.
"Oh, yes," said the Monkey, who thought it was the name of some distinguished citizen, "he is one of my most intimate friends."
Indignant at so gross a deceit and falsehood, the dolphin dived to the bottom, and left the lying monkey to his fate.

The Wolf, the Fox, and the Ape
A wolf accused a fox of theft, but he entirely denied the charge. An ape undertook to judge the matter between them. When each had fully stated his case, the ape pronounced this sentence: "I do not think you, wolf, ever lost what you claim, and I do believe you, fox, to have stolen what you so stoutly deny."
The dishonest, if they act honestly, get no credit.

The Fox and the Monkey
A fox and a monkey were traveling together on the same road. As they journeyed, they passed through a cemetery full of monuments. "All these monuments which you see," said the monkey, "are erected in honor of my ancestors, who were in their day freedmen, and citizens of great renown."
The fox replied; "You have chosen a most appropriate subject for your falsehoods, as I am sure none of your ancestors will be able to contradict you."
A false tale often betrays itself.

The Mouse and the Bull
A bull was bitten by a mouse, and, pained by the wound, tried to capture him. The mouse, however, reached his hole in safety. The bull dug into the walls with his horns until, wearied, he crouched down and slept by the hole.
The mouse, peeping out, crept up his flank and, again biting him, retreated to his hole. The bull rising up, and not knowing what to do, was sadly perplexed. The mouse murmured, "The great do not always prevail."
There are times when the small and lowly are the strongest to do mischief.

The Mouse and the Weasel
A little starveling mouse had made his way with some difficulty into a basket of corn. He enjoyed himself so much that he stuffed and crammed himself. When it came time to leave, he found the hole was too small to allow his puffed-up body to pass. As he sat at the hole groaning over his fate, a weasel, who was brought to the spot by his cries, thus addressed him; "Stop there, my friend, and fast till you are thin; for you will never come out till you reduce yourself to the same condition as when you entered."

The Lion, the Mouse, and the Fox
A lion, fatigued by the heat of a summer's day, fell fast asleep in his den. A mouse ran over his mane and ears and woke him from his slumbers. He rose up and shook himself in great wrath and searched every corner of his den to find the mouse. A fox, seeing him, said, "A fine lion you are, to be frightened of a mouse." "'Tis not the mouse I fear," said the lion. "I resent his familiarity and ill-breeding."
Little liberties are great offences.

The Weasel and the Mice
A weasel, inactive from old age and infirmities, was not able to catch mice as he once did. He therefore rolled himself in flour and lay down in a dark corner. A mouse, supposing him to be food, approached him and, being instantly caught, was squeezed to death. Another perished in a similar manner, and then a third, and still others after them. A very old mouse, who had escaped many a trap and snare, observing from a safe distance the trick of his crafty foe, said; "Ah! You that lie there, may you prosper just in the same proportion as you are what you pretend to be!"

The Lion and the Mouse
A lion was sleeping in his lair when a mouse, not knowing where he was going, ran over the mighty beast's nose and awakened him. The lion clapped his paw upon the frightened little creature and was about to make an end of him in a moment, when the mouse, in pitiable tone, besought him to spare one who had so unconsciously offended, and not stain his honorable paws with so insignificant a prey. The Lion, smiling at his little prisoner's fright, generously let him go.
Now it happened that a short time later the Lion, while ranging the woods for his prey, fell into the toils of the hunters. Finding himself entangled without hope of escape, he set up a roar that filled the whole forest with its echo.
The mouse, recognizing the voice of his former benefactor, ran to the spot and, without more ado, set to work to nibble the knot in the cord that bound the lion. In a short time the mouse set the noble beast at liberty, thus convincing him that kindness is seldom thrown away and that there is no creature so much below another but that he may have it in his power to return a good favor.

The Mice in Council
Once upon a time the mice, being sadly distressed by the persecution of the cat, resolved to call a meeting to decide upon the best means of getting rid of their continual annoyance. Many plans were discussed and rejected. At last a young mouse got up and proposed that a bell should be hung round the cat's neck, that they might for the future always have notice of her coming, and so be able to escape.
This proposition was hailed with the greatest applause, and was agreed to at once unanimously. Upon which an old mouse, who had sat silent all the while, got up and said that he considered the contrivance most ingenious and that it would, no doubt, be quite successful. But he had only one short question, namely, which of them would bell the cat?
It is one thing to propose, another to execute.

The Country Mouse and the Town Mouse
Once upon a time a country mouse, who had a friend in town, invited him, for old acquaintance sake, to pay him a visit in the country. The invitation was accepted in due form, and the country mouse, though plain and rough and somewhat frugal in his nature, opened his heart and store, in honor of hospitality and an old friend. There was not a carefully stored-up morsel that he did not bring forth out of his larder?peas and barley, cheese-parings and nuts?hoping by quantity to make up what he feared was wanting in quality, to suit the palate of his dainty guest.
The town mouse, condescending to pick a bit here and a bit there, while the host sat nibbling a blade of barley-straw, at length exclaimed; "How is it, my good friend, that you can endure the dullness of this unpolished life? You are living like a toad in a hole. You can't really prefer these solitary rocks and woods to streets teeming with carriages and men. On my honor, you are wasting your time miserably here. We must make the most of life while it lasts. A mouse, you know, does not live forever. So come with me and I'll show you life and the town."
Overpowered with such fine words and so polished a manner, the country mouse assented and they set out together on their journey to town. It was late in the evening when they crept stealthily into the city, and midnight ere they reached the great house where the town mouse took up his quarters.
Here were couches of crimson velvet, carvings in ivory; everything, in short, that denoted wealth and luxury. On the table were the remains of a splendid banquet, to procure which all the choicest shops in the town had been ransacked the day before.
It was now the turn of the courtier to play the host; he places his country friend on purple, runs to and fro to supply all his wants, presses dish upon dish and dainty upon dainty, and as though he were waiting on a king, tastes every course ere he ventures to place it before his rustic cousin. The country mouse, for his part, affects to make himself quite at home, and blesses the good fortune that had wrought such a change in his way of life.
In the midst of his enjoyment, as he is thinking with contempt of the poor fare he has forsaken, the door suddenly flies open and a party of revelers, returning from a late entertainment, bursts into the room. The affrighted friends jump from the table in the greatest of consternation and hide themselves in the first corner they can reach. No sooner do they venture to creep out again than the barking of dogs drives them back in still greater terror than before.
At length, when things seemed quiet, the country mouse stole out from his hiding place and, bidding his friend good-bye, whispered in his ear; "Oh, my good sir, this fine mode of living may do for those who like it; but give me my barley-bread in peace and security before the daintiest feast where fear and care are in waiting."

The Cat and the Mice
A cat, grown feeble with age and no longer able to hunt mice as she once did, thought to herself how she might entice them within reach of her paw. Thinking that she might pass herself off for a bag or for a dead cat at least, she suspended herself by the hind legs from a peg, in the hope that the mice would no longer be afraid to come near her.
An old mouse, who was wise enough to keep his distance, whispered to a friend; "Many a bag have I seen in my day, but never one with a cat's head." "Hang there, good madam," said the other, "as long as you please, but I would not trust myself within reach of you though you were stuffed with straw."

The Mice and the Weasels
The mice and the weasels had long been at war with each other, and the mice were constantly being defeated. At length at a meeting, solemnly called, they agreed that their defeat was attributable to nothing but their want of discipline, and they determined accordingly to elect regular commanders for the time to come. So they chose those whose valor and gallantry most recommended them to the important post.
The new commanders were proud of their position and desirous of being as conspicuous as possible, so they bound horns upon their foreheads as a sort of crest and mark of distinction. Not long after a battle ensued. The mice, as before, were soon put to flight; the common herd escaped into their holes; but the commanders, not being able to get in from the length of their horns, were every one caught and devoured.
There is no distinction without its accompanying danger.

The Wolf and the Goat
A wolf seeing a goat feeding on the edge of a high precipice where he could not come at her, besought her to come down lower, for fear she should miss her footing at that dizzy height. "Moreover," said he, "the grass is far sweeter and more abundant here below." But the Goat replied; "Excuse me; it is not for my dinner that you invite me, but for your own."

The Fox and the Goat
A fox had fallen into a well and had been casting about for a long time how he should get out again. At length a goat came to the place and, wanting to drink, asked the fox whether the water was good and if there was plenty of it. The fox, avoiding the real danger of his case, replied, "Come down, my friend; the water is so good that I cannot drink enough of it, and so abundant that it cannot be exhausted."
Upon this the goat without any more ado leaped in. The fox, taking advantage of his friend's horns, nimbly leaped out and coolly remarked to the poor deluded goat; "If you had half as much brains as you have beard, you would have looked before you leaped."
Look before you leap.

The He-Goat and the Wolf
A wolf some time ran after a he-goat, and the he-goat, to save himself, leapt upon a rock where the wolf besieged him. After they had dwelled there two or three days, the wolf began to wax hungry and the he-goat thirsty. So the wolf went to eat and the he-goat went to drink.
As the he-goat drank he saw his shadow in the water. Spying and beholding his shadow, he said to himself, "Thou hast so fair legs, so fair a beard, and so fair horns, and hast fear of the wolf! If it happen that he come again, I shall correct him well and shall keep him well, that he shall have no might over me."
The wolf, who held his peace and hearkened what was said, took him by one leg, thus saying; "What words be these which I hear, brother he-goat?" When the he-goat saw that he was taken, he began to say to the wolf, "Ha! My lord, I say nothing and have pity on me! I know well that it is to my blame." Yet the wolf took him by the neck and strangled him.
It is great folly when the feeble makes war against the powerful and strong.

The Lion and the Goat
On a summer's day, when everything was suffering from extreme heat, a lion and a goat came at the same time to quench their thirst at a small fountain. They at once fell to quarrelling which should first drink of the water, till at length it seemed that each was determined to resist the other even to death.
But, ceasing from the strife for a moment, to recover breath, they saw a flock of vultures hovering over them, only waiting to pounce upon whichever of them should fall. Whereupon they instantly made up their quarrel, agreeing that it was far better for them both to become friends, than to furnish food for the crows and vultures.

The Bull and the Goat
A bull, being pursued by a lion, fled into a cave where a wild goat had taken up his abode. The goat upon this began molesting him and butting at him with his horns. "Don't suppose," said the bull, "if I suffer this now, that it is you I am afraid of. Let the lion be once out of sight and I will soon show you the difference between a bull and a goat."

The Kid and the Wolf
A kid being high on the roof of a lofty house, and seeing a wolf pass below, began to revile him. The wolf merely stopped to reply; "Coward! It is not you who revile me, but the place on which you are standing."

The Lion and the Cow, the Goat and the Sheep
The cow, the goat, and the sheep went hunting in the chase with a lion and they captured a deer. When it came time to part ways and share in their catch, the lion said to them, "My lords, I let you know that the first part is mine, because I am your lord; the second because I am stronger than you; the third because I ran more swift than you did; and whosoever touches the fourth part, he shall be my mortal enemy!"
And thus the lion took for himself alone the deer.

The Goatherd and the Goats
It was a stormy day, and the snow was falling fast, when a goatherd drove his goats, all white with snow, into a desert cave for shelter. There he found that a herd of wild goats, more numerous and larger than his own, had already taken shelter.
Thinking to secure them all, he left his own goats to take care of themselves and threw the branches he had brought for them to the wild goats to browse on. But when the weather cleared up, he found his own goats had perished from hunger, while the wild goats were off and away to the hills and woods.
The goatherd returned a laughing-stock to his neighbors, having failed to gain the wild goats and having lost his own.
They, who neglect their old friends for the sake of new, are rightly served if they lose both.

The Goat and the Ass
A man once kept a goat and an ass. The goat, envying the ass on account of his greater abundance of food, said: "How shamefully you are treated; at one time grinding in the mill, and at another carrying heavy burden." And he further advised him that he should pretend to be epileptic, and fall into a ditch, and so obtain rest. The ass followed his advice and, falling into a ditch, was very much bruised. His master, sending for a leech, asked his advice. He bade him place upon the wounds the liver of a goat. They at once killed the goat and so healed the ass.

The Goat and the Goatherd
A goat had strayed from the herd and the goatherd was trying all he could to bring him back to his companions. When by calling and whistling he could make no impression on him, at last, taking up a stone, he struck the goat on the horn and broke it. Alarmed at what he had done, he besought the goat not to tell his master. But, he replied; "O most foolish of goatherds! My horn will tell the story, though I should not utter a word."
Facts speak plainer than words.

The Vine and the Goat
There was a vine teeming with ripe fruit and tender shoots, when a wanton goat came up and gnawed the bark and browsed upon the young leaves. "I will revenge myself on you," said the vine, "for this insult; for when in a few days you are brought as a victim to the altar, the juice of my grapes shall be the dew of death upon your forehead."
Retribution, though late, comes at last.

The Lark and Her Young Ones
There was a brood of young larks in a field of corn, which was just ripe. The mother, looking every day for reapers, left word whenever she went out in search of food that her young ones should report to her all the news they heard. One day, while she was absent, the master came to look at the state of the crop. "It is full time," said he, "to call in all my neighbors and get my corn reaped."
When the old lark came home, the young ones told their mother what they had heard and begged her to remove them right away. "Time enough," said she. "If he trusts his neighbors, he will have to wait awhile yet for his harvest." The next day, the owner came again, and found the sun still hotter and the corn more ripe, and nothing done. "There is not a moment to be lost," said he. "We cannot depend upon our neighbors; we must call in our relations." Turning to his son he said, "Go call your uncles and cousins and see that they begin tomorrow."
In still greater fear, the young ones repeated to their mother the farmer's words. "If that be all," said she, "do not be frightened, for the relations have got harvest work of their own. But take particular notice what you hear the next time, and be sure you let me know."
She went abroad the next day and the owner, coming as before, and finding the grain falling to the ground from over-ripeness, and still no one at work, called to his son. "We must wait for our neighbors and friends no longer. Go and hire some reapers tonight and we will set to work ourselves tomorrow." When the young ones told their mother this, "Then," said she, "it is time to be off, indeed. For when a man takes up his business himself, instead of leaving it to others, you may be sure that he means to set to work in earnest."

The Peacock and the Crane
A peacock, spreading its gorgeous tail, mocked a crane that passed by, ridiculing the ashen hue of its plumage. Said he, "I am robed like a king in gold and purple and all the colors of the rainbow, while you have not a bit of color on your wings."
"True," replied the crane, "but I soar to the heights of heaven, and lift up my voice to the stars, while you walk below, like a cock, among the birds of the dunghill."
Fine feathers don't make fine birds.

The Fowler and the Viper
A fowler, taking his birdlime and his twigs, went out to catch birds. Seeing a thrush sitting upon a tree, he wished to capture it, and fitting his twigs to a proper length, he watched intently, having his whole thoughts directed towards the sky.
While thus looking upwards, he unawares trod upon a viper asleep, just before his feet. The viper, turning towards him, bit him, and he, falling into a swoon, said to himself; "Woe is me! That while I tried to hunt another, I am myself fallen unawares into the snares of death."

The Wolf and the Crane
A wolf had got a bone stuck in his throat and in the greatest agony ran up and down, beseeching every animal he met to relieve him, at the same time hinting at a very handsome reward to the successful operator. A crane, moved by his entreaties and promises, ventured her long neck down the wolf's throat, and drew out the bone. She then modestly asked for the promised reward. To which the wolf, grinning and showing his teeth, replied with seeming indignation; "Ungrateful creature! To ask for any other reward than that you have put your head in a wolf's jaws, and brought it safe out again!"

The Hen and the Swallow
A hen, finding the eggs of a viper, and carefully keeping them warm, nourished them until they hatched. A swallow, observing what she had done, said; "You silly creature! Why have you hatched these vipers, which, when they shall have grown, will inflict injury on all, beginning with yourself?"

The Crow and the Serpent
A crow, in great want of food, saw a serpent asleep in a sunny nook and, flying down, greedily seized him. The serpent turned about and bit the crow with a mortal wound. The crow, in the agony of death, exclaimed, "Oh unhappy me! Who have found in that which I deemed a happy windfall the source of my destruction."

The Falconer and the Partridge
A falconer caught a partridge in his net. The bird cried out sorrowfully, "Let me go, good master falconer, and I promise you I will decoy other partridges into your net."
"No," said the man, "whatever I might have done, I am determined now not to spare you; for there is no death too bad for him who is ready to betray his friends."

The Eagle and the Jackdaw
An eagle made a swoop from a high rock and carried off a lamb. A jackdaw, who saw the exploit, thinking that he could do the like, bore down with all the force he could muster upon a ram, intending to bear him off as a prize. But his claws becoming entangled in the wool, and he made such a fluttering in his efforts to escape, that the shepherd, seeing through the whole matter, came up and caught him. Clipping the jackdaw?s wings, the shepherd carried him home to his children at nightfall.
"What bird is this, father that you have brought us?" exclaimed the children. "Why," said he, "if you ask him, he will tell you that he is an eagle. But if you take my word for it, I know him to be nothing but a jackdaw."

The Dog, the Cock, and the Fox
A dog and a cock having struck up an acquaintance went out on their travels together. Nightfall found them in a forest, so the cock, flying up on a tree, perched among the branches, while the dog dozed below at the foot. As the night passed away and the day dawned, the cock, according to his custom, set up a shrill crowing.
A fox, hearing him and thinking to make a meal of him, came and stood under the tree and thus addressed him: "Thou art a good little bird and most useful to thy fellow creatures. Come down, then, that we may sing and rejoice together."
The cock replied; "Go, my good friend, to the foot of the tree, and call the church elders to toll the bell." But as the Fox went to call them, the cog jumped out in a moment, seized the fox, and made an end of him.
They who lay traps for others are often caught by their own bait.

The Singing Kites
The kites of old time had, equally with the swans, the privilege of song. But having heard the neigh of the horse, they were so enchanted with the sound that they tried to imitate it. In trying to neigh, they forgot how to sing.
The desire for imaginary benefits often involves the loss of present blessings.

The Crow and the Pitcher
A crow, ready to die with thirst, flew with joy to a pitcher, which he saw at a distance. But when he came up to it, he found the water so low that with all his stooping and straining he was unable to reach it. So he tried to break the pitcher, then to overturn it, but his strength was not sufficient to do either. At last, seeing some small pebbles at hand, he dropped a great many of them, one by one, into the pitcher, and so raised the water to the brim and quenched his thirst.

The Ass, the Cock, and the Lion
An ass and a cock lived in a farmyard together. One day a hungry lion passing by and, seeing the ass in good condition, resolved to make a meal of him. Now, they say that there is nothing a lion hates so much as the crowing of a cock, and at that moment the cock happened to crow. The lion straightway made off with all haste from the spot.
The ass, mightily amused to think that a lion should be frightened at a bird, plucked up the courage and galloped after him, delighted with the notion of driving the king of beasts before him. He had, however, gone no great distance, when the lion turned sharply round upon him and made an end of him in a trice.
Presumption begins in ignorance and ends in ruin.

The Swallow and the Raven
The swallow and the raven contended which was the finer bird. The raven ended by saying, "Your beauty is but for the summer, but mine will stand many winters."
Durability is better than show.

The Owl and the Birds
When the acorn first began to sprout, an owl, in her wisdom, counseled the birds to pull it up by all means out of the ground and not allow it to grow. It would, said she, produce the mistletoe from which a bird poison would be extracted, by which they would be captured.
The owl next advised them to pluck up the seed of the flax that men had sown, as it was a plant that brought no good to them.
Lastly the owl, seeing an archer approach, predicted that this man, being on foot, would contrive darts armed with feathers, which should fly faster than the wings of the birds themselves.
The birds gave no credence to these warning words, but considered the owl to be beside herself and said that she was mad. But afterwards, finding her words were true, they wondered at her knowledge and deemed her to be the wisest of birds. Hence it is that when she appears they flock to her as knowing all things; while she no longer gives them advice, but in solitude laments their past folly.

The Kite and the Pigeons
Some pigeons had long lived in fear of a kite, but by being always on the alert and keeping near their dove-house, they determined to escape the attacks of the enemy. Finding his sallies unsuccessful, the kite resorted to guile.
"Why," said the kite, "do you prefer this life of continual anxiety, when, if you would only make me your king, I would secure you from every attack that could be made upon you?"
The pigeons, trusting to his professions, called him to the throne. No sooner was he established there than he exercised his power by devouring a pigeon a day. Whereupon one that yet awaited his turn, said no more than, "It serves us right."

The Fox and the Cock
A fox came toward a cock and said to him, "I would like know if you can sing as well as your father did." The cock shut his eyes and began to cry and sing and the fox took and carried him away. The people of the town started crying, "The fox is getting away with the cock!"
The cock then said to the fox, "My lord, don't you understand what the people are saying, that you are taking their cock? Tell them that it is your cock and not theirs." As the fox said, "It is not yours, but it is mine," the cock escaped from the fox's mouth and flew up a tree.
Then the cock said to the fox, "You lied, for I am theirs and not yours." The fox began to hit the earth with his mouth and head, saying, "Mouth, you have spoken too much! You should have eaten the cock had not your words been too many."
Much talking causes harm and too much crowing causes hurt.

The Tortoise and the Eagle
A tortoise, dissatisfied with his lowly life, when he beheld so many of the birds, his neighbors, disporting themselves in the clouds, and thinking that, if he could but once get up into the air, he could soar with the best of them, called one day upon an eagle and offered him all the treasures of the ocean if he could only teach him to fly.
The eagle would have declined the task, assuring him that the thing was not only absurd but impossible. Being further pressed by the entreaties and promises of the tortoise, he at length consented to do for him the best he could.
The eagle took the tortoise up to a great height in the air and loosed his hold upon him. "Now, then!" cried the eagle. But the tortoise, before he could answer him a word, fell plump upon a rock and was dashed to pieces.

The Gamecocks and the Partridge
A man had two gamecocks in his poultry yard. One day by chance he saw a tame partridge for sale. He purchased it and brought it home that it might be reared with his gamecocks. On its being put into the poultry yard they struck at it and followed it about, so that the partridge was grievously troubled in mind and supposed that he was thus evilly treated because he was a stranger. Not long afterwards, he saw the cocks fighting together, and not separating before one had well beaten the other. He then said to himself; "I shall no longer distress myself at being struck at by these gamecocks, when I see that they cannot even refrain from quarreling with each other."

The Raven and the Swan
A raven envied a swan the whiteness of her plumage. Thinking that the swan's beauty was owing to the water in which she lived, the raven deserted the altars where he used to find his livelihood and took to the pools and streams. There he plumed and dressed himself and washed his coat, but all to no purpose, for his plumage remained as black as ever, and he himself soon perished for want of his usual food
The Fox and the Crow
A crow had snatched a goodly piece of cheese out of a window, and flew with it into a high tree, intent to enjoy her prize. A fox spied the dainty morsel and thus planned his approaches.
"Oh crow," said he, "how beautiful are thy wings, how bright thine eye! How graceful thy neck! Thy breast is the breast of an eagle! Thy claws?I beg pardon?thy talons, are a match for all the beasts of the field. Oh! That such a bird should be dumb, and want only a voice!"
The crow, pleased with the flattery and chuckling to think how she would surprise the fox with her caw, opened her mouth. Down dropped the cheese! The fox snapping up observed, as he walked away, that ?whatever he had remarked of her beauty, he had said nothing yet of her brains.?
Men seldom flatter without some private end in view, and they who listen to such music may expect to have to pay the piper.

The Birds, the Beasts, and the Bat
Once upon a time there was a fierce war waged between the birds and the beasts. For a long while the issue of the battle was uncertain, and the bat, taking advantage of his ambiguous nature, kept aloof and remained neutral.
At length when the beasts seemed to prevail, the bat joined their forces and appeared active in the fight. After a successful rally made by the birds, he was found among the ranks of the winning party.
A peace being speedily concluded, the bat's conduct was condemned alike by both parties. Being acknowledged by neither, he was excluded from the terms of the truce. He was obliged to skulk off as best he could and has ever since lived in holes and corners, never daring to show his face except in the duskiness of twilight.

The Cat and the Cock
A cat caught a cock and took counsel with himself how he might find a reasonable excuse for eating him. He accused him of being a nuisance to men, by crowing in the nighttime, and not permitting them to sleep.
The cock defended himself by saying that he did this for the benefit of men that they might raise early for their labors.
The cat replied; "Although you abound in specious apologies, I shall not remain without my supper." He made a meal of him.

The Farmer and the Cranes
Some cranes settled down in a farmer's field that was newly sown. For some time the farmer frightened them away by brandishing an empty sling at them. But when the cranes found that he was only slinging to the winds, they no longer minded him, nor flew away. Upon this the farmer slung at them with stones and killed a great part of them. "Let us be off," said the rest, "to the land of the pygmies, for this man means to threaten us no longer, but is determined to get rid of us in earnest."

The Geese and the Cranes
Some geese and cranes fed together in the same field. One day the sportsmen came suddenly down upon them. The cranes, being light of body, flew off in a moment and escaped, but the geese, weighed down by their fat, were all taken.
In civil commotions, they fare best that have the least to fetter them.

The Eagle and the Fox
An eagle and a fox had long lived together as good neighbors; the eagle at the summit of a high tree, the fox in a hole at the foot of it. One day, however, while the fox was abroad, the eagle made a swoop at the fox's cub and carried it off to her nest, thinking that her lofty dwelling would secure her from the fox's revenge.
The fox, on her return home, upbraided the eagle for this breach of friendship, and begged earnestly to have her young one again. Finding that her entreaties were of no avail, she snatched a torch from an altar-fire that had been lighted hard. Involving the whole tree in flame and smoke, she soon made the eagle restore, through fear for herself and her own young ones, the cub that she had just now denied to her most earnest prayers.
The tyrant, though he may despise the tears of the oppressed, is never safe from their vengeance.

The Sick Kite
A kite, who had been long very ill, said to his mother; "Don't cry, mother; but go and pray to the gods that I may recover from this dreadful disease and pain." "Alas, child," said the mother, "which of the gods can I entreat for one who has robbed all their altars?"
Deathbed repentance is a poor remedy for the errors of a lifetime.

The Vain Jackdaw
A jackdaw, as vain and conceited as a jackdaw could be, picked up the feathers which some peacock had shed, stuck them amongst his own, and despising his old companions, introduced himself with the greatest assurance into a flock of those beautiful birds. They instantly detected the intruder, stripped him of his borrowed plumes, fell upon him with their beaks, and sent him about his business.
The unlucky jackdaw, sorely punished and deeply sorrowing, returned to his former companions, and would have flocked with them again as if nothing had happened. But they, recollecting what airs he had given himself, drummed him out of their society.
One of those whom he had so lately despised lectured him: "Had you been contented with what nature made you, you would have escaped the chastisement of your betters and also the contempt of your peers."

The Husbandman and the Stork
A husbandman fixed a net in his field to catch the cranes that came to feed on his new-sown corn. When he went to examine the net, and see what cranes he had taken, a stork was found among the number. "Spare me," cried the stork, "and let me go. See I am no crane. See I have eaten none of your corn. I am a poor innocent stork, as you may see the most pious and dutiful of birds. I honor and succor my father and mother. I?"
But the husbandman cut him short. "All this may be true enough, I dare say, but this I know, that I have caught you with those who were destroying my crops, and you must suffer with the company in which you are taken."
One is often judged by the company one keeps.

The Bird Catcher, the Partridge, and the Cock
A bird catcher was about to sit down to a dinner of herbs, when a friend unexpectedly came in. The bird trap was quite empty, as he had caught nothing. He proceeded to kill a partridge, which he had tamed for a decoy. The partridge pleaded earnestly for his life; "What would you do without me when next you spread your nets? Who would chirp you to sleep, or call for you the covey of answering birds?"
The bird catcher spared his life, and determined to pick out a fine young cock just attaining to his comb. He thus cried in piteous tones from his perch; "If you kill me, who will announce to you the appearance of the dawn? Who will wake you to your daily tasks or tell you when it is time to visit the bird trap in the morning?" He replied; "What you say is true. You are a capital bird at telling the time of day. But I and the friend who has arrived must have our dinners.
The Eagle and the Arrow
A bowman took aim at an eagle and hit him in the heart. As the eagle turned his head in the agonies of death, he saw that the arrow was winged with his own feathers. "How much sharper," said he, "are the wounds made by weapons which we ourselves have supplied?"

The Bird Catcher and the Lark
A bird-catcher was setting springs upon a common, when a lark, who saw him at work, asked him from a distance what he was doing. "I am establishing a colony," said he, "and laying the foundations of my first city." Upon that, the man retired to a little distance and hid himself. The lark, believing his assertion, soon flew down to the place and, swallowing the bait, found himself entangled in the noose. The bird-catcher straightway coming up to him and made him his prisoner. "A pretty fellow are you!" said the lark. "If these are the colonies you found, you will not find many emigrants."

The Thirsty Pigeon
A pigeon severely pressed by thirst, seeing a glass of water painted upon a sign, supposed it to be real. So dashing down at it with all her might, she struck against the board and, breaking her wing, fell helpless to the ground, where she was quickly captured by one of the passersby.
Great haste is not always good speed.

The Crow and the Sheep
A troublesome crow seated herself on the back of a sheep. The sheep, much against his will, carried her backward and forward for a long time and at last said: "If you had treated a dog in this way, you would have had your deserts from his sharp teeth." To this the crow replied; "I despise the weak and yield to the strong. I know whom I may bully and whom I must flatter, and thus I hope to prolong my life to a good old age."

The Ant and the Dove
An ant went to a fountain to quench his thirst and, tumbling in, was almost drowned. But a dove that happened to be sitting on a neighboring tree saw the ant's danger and, plucking off a leaf, let it drop into the water before him. The ant mounting upon it, was presently wafted safely ashore.
Just at that time, a fowler was spreading his net and was in the act of ensnaring the dove, when the ant, perceiving his object, bit his heel. The start this gave the man made him drop his net and the dove, aroused to a sense of her danger, flew safely away.
One good turn deserves another.

The Fox and the Stork
A fox one day invited a stork to dinner, and being disposed to divert himself at the expense of his guest, provided nothing for the entertainment but some thin soup in a shallow dish. This the fox lapped up very readily, while the stork, unable to gain a mouthful with her long narrow bill, was as hungry at the end of dinner as when she began. The fox meanwhile professed his regret at seeing her eat so sparingly and feared that the dish was not seasoned to her mind.
The stork said little, but begged that the fox would do her the honor of returning her visit. Accordingly he agreed to dine with her on the following day. He arrived true to his appointment and the dinner was ordered forthwith.
When the meal was served up, the fox found to his dismay that it was contained in a narrow-necked vessel, down which the stork readily thrust her long neck and bill, while he was obliged to content himself with licking the neck of the jar. Unable to satisfy his hunger, he retired with as good a grace as he could, observing that he could hardly find fault with his entertainer, who had only paid him back in his own coin.

The Swallow in Chancery
A swallow had built her nest under the eaves of a court of justice. Before her young ones could fly, a serpent gliding out of his hole ate them all up. When the poor bird returned to her nest and found it empty, she began a pitiable wailing. A neighbor suggested, by way of comfort, that she was not the first bird who had lost her young. "True," she replied, "but it is not my little ones that I mourn, but that I should have been wronged in that very place where the injured fly for justice."

The Widow and the Hen
A widow woman kept a hen that laid an egg every morning. Thought the woman to herself, "If I double my hen's allowance of barley, she will lay twice a day." So she tried her plan, and the hen became so fat and sleek that she left off laying at all.

The Dove and the Crow
A dove that was kept shut up in a cage was congratulating herself upon the number of her family. "Cease, good soul," said a crow, "to boast on that subject; for the more young ones you have, so many more slaves will you have to groan over."
What are blessings in freedom are curses in slavery.

The Serpent and the Eagle
A serpent and an eagle were struggling with each other in a deadly conflict. The serpent had the advantage, and was about to strangle the bird. A countryman saw them and, running up, loosed the coil of the serpent and let the eagle go free. The serpent, irritated at the escape of his prey, some time later injected his poison into the drinking cup of the countryman. The rustic, ignorant of his danger, was about to drink, when the eagle struck his hand with his wing and, seizing the drinking cup in his talons, carried it away.

The Cock and the Jewel
As a cock was scratching up the straw in a farmyard, in search of food for the hens, he hit upon a jewel that by some chance had found its way there. "Ho!" said he, "you are a very fine thing, no doubt, to those who prize you; but give me a barley-corn before all the pearls in the world."

The Peacock and Juno
The peacock made complaint to the goddess Juno that, while the nightingale pleased every ear with his song, he, the proud peacock, no sooner opened his mouth than he became a laughingstock to all who heard him. The goddess, to console him, said; "But you far excel in beauty and in size. The splendor of the emerald shines in your neck and you unfold a tail gorgeous with painted plumage."
"But for what purpose have I," said the bird, "this dumb beauty as long as I am surpassed in song?" "The lot of each," replied Juno, "has been assigned by the will of the Fates?to you, beauty; to the eagle, strength; to the nightingale, song; to the raven, favorable, and to the crow, unfavorable expectations. These are all contented with the endowments allotted to them."

The Gull and the Kite
A gull had pounced upon a fish and, in endeavoring to swallow it, got choked and lay upon the deck for dead. A kite who was passing by and saw him gave him no other comfort than; "It serves you right. For what business have the fowls of the air to meddle with the fish of the sea?"

The Fighting Cocks and the Eagle
Two young cocks were fighting as fiercely as if they had been men. At last the one that was beaten crept into a corner of the henhouse, covered with wounds. But the conqueror, straightway flying up to the top of the house, began clapping his wings and crowing, to announce his victory. At this moment an eagle, sailing by, seized him in his talons and bore him away. The defeated rival came out from his hiding place, and took possession of the dunghill for which they had contended.

The Eagle and the Beetle
A hare, being pursued by an eagle, took himself for refuge to the nest of a beetle, whom he entreated to save him. The beetle therefore interceded with the eagle, begging of him not to kill the poor suppliant, and pleaded with him, by mighty Jupiter, not to break the laws of hospitality because he was so small an animal. But the eagle, in wrath, gave the beetle a flap of his wing, and straightway seized upon the hare and devoured him.
When the eagle flew away, the beetle flew after him, to learn where his nest was. Getting into the nest, the beetle rolled the eagle's eggs out of it one by one and broke them. The eagle, grieved and enraged to think that any one should attempt so audacious a thing, built his nest the next time in a higher place. But there, too, the beetle got at it again and served him in the same manner as before.
Upon this the eagle, being at a loss what to do, flew up to Jupiter, his Lord and King, and placed the third brood of eggs as a sacred deposit in his lap, begging him to guard them for him. But the beetle, having made a little ball of dirt, flew up with it and dropped it in Jupiter's lap, who, rising up on a sudden to shake it off and forgetting the eggs, threw them down and they were again broken.
Jupiter, being informed by the beetle that he had done this to be revenged upon the eagle who had not only wronged him, but had acted impiously towards Jove himself, told the eagle, when he came to him, that the beetle was the aggrieved party and that he complained not without reason. Being unwilling that the race of eagles should be diminished, he advised the beetle to come to peace with the eagle. As the beetle would not agree to this, Jupiter transferred the eagle's breeding to another season, when there are no beetles to be seen.
No one can slight the laws of hospitality with impunity; and there is no station or influence, however powerful, that can protect the oppressor, in the end, from the vengeance of the oppressed.

The Hen and the Cat
A cat, hearing that a hen was laid up sick in her nest, paid her a visit of condolence. Creeping up to her the cat said, "How are you, my dear friend? What can I do for you? What are you in want of? Only tell me, if there is anything in the world that I can bring you; but keep up your spirits, and don't be alarmed." "Thank you," said the hen, "be good enough to leave me, and I have no fear but I shall soon be well."
Unbidden guests are often the most welcome when they are gone.

The Image of Mercury and the Carpenter
A very poor man, a carpenter by trade, had a wooden image of Mercury before which he made offerings day by day. He entreated the idol to make him rich: but in spite of his entreaties he became poorer and poorer. At last, being very wroth, he took his image down from its pedestal, and dashed it against the wall.
When the idol?s head was knocked off, out came a stream of gold, which the carpenter picked up and said; "Well, I think you are altogether contradictory and unreasonable; for when I paid you honor, I reaped no benefits, but now that I maltreat you, I am loaded with an abundance of riches."

The Traveler and Fortune
A traveler, wearied with a long journey, lay down overcome with fatigue on the very brink of a deep well. Being within an inch of falling into the water, Dame Fortune, it is said, appeared to him. Waking him from his slumber, she addressed him; "Good sir, pray wake up, for had you fallen into the well, the blame would be thrown on me, and I should get an ill name among mortals. I find that men are sure to charge their calamities to me, however much by their own folly they have really brought them on themselves."
Every one is more or less master of his own fate.

Jupiter and the Camel
When the camel, in days of yore, besought Jupiter to grant him horns, for that it was a great grief to him to see other animals furnished with them, while he had none. Jupiter not only refused to give him the horns he asked for, but cropped his ears short for his importunity.
By asking too much, we may lose the little that we had before.

Hercules and the Waggoner
As a countryman was carelessly driving his wagon along a miry lane, his wheels stuck so deep in the clay that the horses came to a standstill. Upon this the man, without making the least effort of his own, began to call upon Hercules to come and help him out of his trouble. But Hercules bade him lay his shoulder to the wheel, assuring him that heaven only aided those who endeavored to help themselves.

The Peacock and Juno
The peacock made complaint to the goddess Juno that, while the nightingale pleased every ear with his song, he, the proud peacock, no sooner opened his mouth than he became a laughingstock to all who heard him. The goddess, to console him, said; "But you far excel in beauty and in size. The splendor of the emerald shines in your neck and you unfold a tail gorgeous with painted plumage."
"But for what purpose have I," said the bird, "this dumb beauty as long as I am surpassed in song?" "The lot of each," replied Juno, "has been assigned by the will of the Fates?to you, beauty; to the eagle, strength; to the nightingale, song; to the raven, favorable, and to the crow, unfavorable expectations. These are all contented with the endowments allotted to them."

Mercury and the Woodsman
A woodsman was felling a tree on the bank of a river and by chance let slip his axe into the water, when it immediately sunk to the bottom. Being in great distress, he sat down by the side of the stream and lamented his loss bitterly. But Mercury, whose river it was, took compassion on him and appeared at that instant before him.
Hearing the cause of his sorrow, Mercury dove to the bottom of the river, brought up a golden axe, and asked the woodman if that were his. Upon the man's denying it, Mercury dove a second time and brought up one of silver. Again the man denied that it was his. So diving a third time, Mercury produced the identical axe that the man had lost. "That is mine!" said the woodman, delighted to have recovered his own. Mercury was so pleased with the fellow's truth and honesty that he at once made him a present of the other two.
The woodsman went to his companions and gave them an account of what had happened to him. One of the companions determined to try whether he might not have the same good fortune. So, repairing to the same place, as if for the purpose of cutting wood, he let his axe slip on purpose into the river, and then sat down on the bank and made a great show of weeping.
Mercury appeared as before, and hearing from him that his tears were caused by the loss of his axe, dived once more into the stream. Bringing up a golden axe, Mercury asked him if that was the axe he had lost. "Aye, surely," said the man, eagerly. He was about to grasp the treasure when Mercury, to punish his impudence and lying, not only refused to give him that, but would not so much as restore him his own axe again.

Jupiter and the Bee
In days of yore, when the world was young, a bee that had stored her combs with a bountiful harvest flew up to heaven to present as a sacrifice an offering of honey. Jupiter was so delighted with the gift that he promised to give her whatsoever she should ask for. She therefore besought him, saying; "O glorious Jove, maker and master of me, poor bee, give thy servant a sting, that when any one approaches my hive to take the honey, I may kill him on the spot."
Jupiter, out of his love to man, was angry at her request, and thus answered her: "Your prayer shall not be granted in the way you wish, but the sting which you ask for you shall have. When anyone comes to take away your honey and you attack him, the wound shall be fatal not to him but to you, for your life shall go with your sting."

Jupiter and the Monkey
Jupiter issued a proclamation to all the beasts of the forest and promised a royal reward to the one whose offspring should be deemed the handsomest. The monkey came with the rest, and presented, with all a mother's tenderness, a flat-nosed, hairless, ill-featured young monkey as a candidate for the promised reward. A general laugh saluted her on the presentation of her son. But she resolutely said; "I know not whether Jupiter will allot the prize to my son; but this I do know, that he is at least in the eyes of me, his mother, the dearest, handsomest, and most beautiful of all."

The Flea and the Wrestler
A flea settled upon the bare foot of a wrestler and bit him, on which the wrestler called loudly upon Hercules for help. The flea a second time lighted upon his foot, when he groaned and said, "Oh Hercules! If you will not help me against a flea, how can I hope for your assistance against greater antagonists?"

Jupiter, Neptune, Minerva, and Momus
Jupiter, Neptune, and Minerva, as the story goes, once contended which of them should make the most perfect thing. Jupiter made a man, Pallas made a house, and Neptune made a bull. Momus, who had not yet been turned out of Olympus, was chosen judge to decide which production had the greatest merit.
Momus began by finding fault with the bull because his horns were not below his eyes, so that he might see when he butted with them. Next he found fault with the man because there was no window in his breast that all might see his inward thoughts and feelings. Lastly he found fault with the house because it had no wheels to enable its inhabitants to leave bad neighbors behind.
Jupiter forthwith drove the critic out of heaven, telling him that a faultfinder could never be pleased, and that it was time to criticize the works of others when he had done some good thing himself.

The Frogs Asking for a King
In the days of old, when the frogs were all at liberty in the lakes and had grown quite weary of following every one his own devices, they assembled one day together. With no little clamor they petitioned Jupiter to let them have a king to keep them in better order and make them lead more honest lives.
Jupiter, knowing the vanity of their hearts, smiled at their request, and threw down a log into the lake, which by the splash and commotion it made, sent the whole commonwealth into the greatest terror and amazement. They rushed under the water and into the mud, and dared not come within ten leaps' length of the spot where it lay.
At length one frog, bolder than the rest, ventured to pop his head above the water and take a survey of their new king at a respectful distance. Presently, when they perceived the log lie stock-still, others began to swim up to it and around it. By degrees, growing bolder and bolder, they at last leaped upon it and treated it with the greatest contempt.
Dissatisfied with so tame a ruler, they forthwith petitioned Jupiter a second time for another and more active king, upon which he sent them a stork. It no sooner arrived among them than he began laying hold of them and devouring them one by one as fast as he could, and it was in vain that they endeavored to escape him.
Then they sent Mercury with a private message to Jupiter, beseeching him that he would take pity on them once more; but Jupiter replied that they were only suffering the punishment due to their folly, and that another time they would learn to let well alone, and not be dissatisfied with their natural condition.

Mercury and the Sculptor
Mercury, having a mind to know in what estimation he was held among men, disguised himself as a traveler. Going into a sculptor's workshop, he began asking the price of the different statues he saw there.
Pointing to an image of Jupiter, the traveler asked how much he wanted for that. "A drachma," said the image-maker. Mercury laughed in his sleeve and asked, "How much for this one of Juno?" The man wanted a higher price for that.
Mercury's eye now caught his own image. "Now, will this fellow," thought he, "ask me ten times as much for this, for I am the messenger of heaven, and the source of all his gain?" So he put the question to him, what he valued that statue of Mercury at.
"Well," says the sculptor, "if you will give me my price for the other two, I will throw that into the bargain."
They, who are over-anxious to know how the world values them, will seldom be set down at their own price.

The Eagle and the Beetle
A hare, being pursued by an eagle, took himself for refuge to the nest of a beetle, whom he entreated to save him. The beetle therefore interceded with the eagle, begging of him not to kill the poor suppliant, and pleaded with him, by mighty Jupiter, not to break the laws of hospitality because he was so small an animal. But the eagle, in wrath, gave the beetle a flap of his wing, and straightway seized upon the hare and devoured him.
When the eagle flew away, the beetle flew after him, to learn where his nest was. Getting into the nest, the beetle rolled the eagle's eggs out of it one by one and broke them. The eagle, grieved and enraged to think that any one should attempt so audacious a thing, built his nest the next time in a higher place. But there, too, the beetle got at it again and served him in the same manner as before.
Upon this the eagle, being at a loss what to do, flew up to Jupiter, his Lord and King, and placed the third brood of eggs as a sacred deposit in his lap, begging him to guard them for him. But the beetle, having made a little ball of dirt, flew up with it and dropped it in Jupiter's lap, who, rising up on a sudden to shake it off and forgetting the eggs, threw them down and they were again broken.

Being unwilling that the race of eagles should be diminished, he advised the beetle to come to peace with the eagle. As the beetle would not agree to this, Jupiter transferred the eagle's breeding to another season, when there are no beetles to be seen.
No one can slight the laws of hospitality with impunity; and there is no station or influence, however powerful, that can protect the oppressor, in the end, from the vengeance of the oppressed.

Venus and the Cat
A cat, having fallen in love with a young man, besought Venus to change her into a girl in the hope of gaining his affections. The goddess, taking compassion on her weakness, changed her into a fair damsel and the young man, enamored of her beauty, led her home as his bride.
As they were sitting in their chamber, Venus, wishing to know whether in changing her form she had also changed her nature, set down a mouse before her. The girl, forgetful of her new condition, started from her seat, and pounced upon the mouse as if she would have eaten it on the spot. Whereupon the goddess, provoked at her frivolity, straightway turned her into a cat again.
What is bred in the bone will never be out of the flesh.

The Man and the Satyr
A man and a satyr, having struck up an acquaintance, sat down together to eat. The day being wintry and cold, the man put his fingers to his mouth and blew upon them. "What's that for, my friend?" asked the satyr. "My hands are so cold," said the man, "I do it to warm them."
In a little while some hot food was placed before them, and the man, raising the dish to his mouth, again blew upon it. "And what's the meaning of that, now?" said the satyr. "Oh," replied the man, "my porridge is so hot, I do it to cool it." "Nay, then," said the satyr, "from this moment I renounce your friendship, for I will have nothing to do with one who blows hot and cold with the same mouth."

The Ass and His Masters
An ass that belonged to a gardener, and had little to eat and much to do, besought Jupiter to release him from the gardener's service and give him another master. Jupiter, angry at his discontent, gave him over to a potter. He had now heavier burdens to carry than before and again appealed to Jupiter to relieve him, who accordingly contrived that he should be sold to a tanner.
The ass having now fallen into worse hands than ever, and daily observing how his master was employed, exclaimed with a groan; "Alas, wretch that I am! It had been better for me to have remained content with my former masters, for now I see that my present owner not only works me harder while living, but will not even spare my hide when I am dead!"
He that is discontented in one place will seldom be happy in another.

The Lion in Love
It happened in the days of old that a lion fell in love with a woodsman's daughter and had the folly to ask her of her father in marriage. The woodsman was not much pleased with the offer and declined the honor of so dangerous an alliance.
Upon the lion threatening him with his royal displeasure, the poor man, seeing that so formidable a creature was not to be denied, hit at length upon this expedient: "I feel greatly flattered," said he, "with your proposal. But, noble sir, what great teeth you have got! And what great claws you have got! Where is the damsel that would not be frightened at such weapons as these? You must have your teeth drawn and your claws pared before you can be a suitable bridegroom for my daughter."
The lion straightway submitted, for what will not a body do for love, and then called upon the father to accept him as a son-in-law. But the woodsman, no longer afraid of the tamed and disarmed bully, seized a stout cudgel and drove the unreasonable suitor from his door.

The Ass, the Fox, and the Lion
An ass and a fox, having made a compact alliance, went out into the fields to hunt. They met a lion on the way. The fox, seeing the danger, made up to the lion and whispered that he would betray the ass into his power if he would promise to bear him harmless. The lion agreed and the Fox contrived to lead the ass into a snare. The lion no sooner saw the ass secured than he fell at once upon the fox, reserving the other for his next meal.

The Lion and the Dolphin
A lion was roaming on the seashore when, seeing a dolphin basking on the surface of the water, he invited him to form an alliance with him; "For," said he, "as I am the king of the beasts, and you are the king of the fishes, we ought to be the greatest friends and allies possible."
The dolphin gladly assented and the lion, not long after, having a fight with a wild bull, called upon the dolphin for his promised support. But when he, though ready to assist him, found himself unable to come out of the sea for the purpose, the lion accused him of having betrayed him.
"Do not blame me," said the dolphin in reply, "but blame my nature, which however powerful at sea, is altogether helpless on land."

The Lion, the Mouse, and the Fox
A lion, fatigued by the heat of a summer's day, fell fast asleep in his den. A mouse ran over his mane and ears and woke him from his slumbers. He rose up and shook himself in great wrath and searched every corner of his den to find the mouse. A fox, seeing him, said, "A fine lion you are, to be frightened of a mouse." "'Tis not the mouse I fear," said the lion. "I resent his familiarity and ill-breeding."
Little liberties are great offences.

The Wolf and the Lion
A wolf, roaming by the mountain's side, saw his own shadow, as the sun was setting, become greatly extended and magnified, and he said to himself; "Why should I, being of such an immense size, and extending nearly an acre in length, be afraid of the Lion? Ought I not to be acknowledged as King of all the collected beasts?" While he was indulging in these proud thoughts, a Lion fell upon him and killed him. He exclaimed with a too-late repentance; "Wretched me! This over estimation of myself is the cause of my destruction."

The Bowman and the Lion
A man, who was very skillful with his bow, went up into the mountains to hunt. At his approach there was instantly a great consternation and rout among all the wild beasts, the lion alone showing any determination to fight.
"Stop," said the bowman to him, "and await my messenger, who has somewhat to say to you." With that he sent an arrow after the lion and wounded him in the side. The lion, smarting with anguish, fled into the depth of the thickets, but a fox seeing him run, bade him take courage and face his enemy. "No," said the lion, "you will not persuade me to that; for if the messenger he sends is so sharp, what must be the power of him who sends it?"

The Fox and the Lion
A fox saw a lion confined in a cage and, standing near him, bitterly reviled him. The lion said to the fox; "It is not thou who revilest me; but this mischance which has befallen me."

The Dogs and the Fox
Some dogs found the skin of a lion and began to tear it to pieces with their teeth. A fox, seeing them, said; "If this lion were alive, you would soon find out that his claws were stronger than your teeth."
It is easy to kick a man that is down.

The Wolf and the Lion
One day a wolf seized a sheep from a fold and was carrying it home to his own den. He met a lion that straightway laid hold of the sheep and bore it away. The wolf, standing at a distance, cried out that it was a great shame and that the lion had robbed him of his own. The lion laughed and said, "I suppose, then, that it was your good friend the shepherd who gave it to you."

The Ass, the Cock, and the Lion
An ass and a cock lived in a farmyard together. One day a hungry lion passing by and, seeing the ass in good condition, resolved to make a meal of him. Now, they say that there is nothing a lion hates so much as the crowing of a cock, and at that moment the cock happened to crow. The lion straightway made off with all haste from the spot.
The ass, mightily amused to think that a lion should be frightened at a bird, plucked up the courage and galloped after him, delighted with the notion of driving the king of beasts before him. He had, however, gone no great distance, when the lion turned sharply round upon him and made an end of him in a trice.
Presumption begins in ignorance and ends in ruin.

The Lion and His Three Councilors
The lion called the sheep to ask her if his breath smelled. She said Aye, so he bit off her head for a fool. He called the wolf and asked him. He said No, so he tore him in pieces for a flatterer. At last he called the fox and asked him. Truly he had got a cold, and could not smell.
Wise men say nothing in dangerous times.

The Lion and the Cow, the Goat and the Sheep
The cow, the goat, and the sheep went hunting in the chase with a lion and they captured a deer. When it came time to part ways and share in their catch, the lion said to them, "My lords, I let you know that the first part is mine, because I am your lord; the second because I am stronger than you; the third because I ran more swift than you did; and whosoever touches the fourth part, he shall be my mortal enemy!"
And thus the lion took for himself alone the deer.

The Lion and the Fox
A fox agreed to wait upon a lion in the capacity of a servant. Each for a time performed the part belonging to his station; the fox used to point out the prey, and the lion fell upon it and seized it. But the fox, beginning to think himself as good a beast as his master, begged to be allowed to hunt the game instead of finding it. His request was granted, but as he was in the act of making a descent upon a herd, the huntsmen came out upon him, and he was himself made the prize.

The Farmer and the Lion
A lion entered one day into a farmyard, and the farmer, wishing to catch him, shut the gate. When the lion found that he could not get out, he began at once to attack the sheep and then the oxen. The farmer, afraid for himself, opened the gate and the Lion made off as fast as he could.
His wife, who had observed it all, when she saw her husband in great trouble at the loss of his cattle, cried out; "You are rightly served; for what could have made you so mad as to wish to detain a creature, whom, if you saw at a distance, you would wish further off?"
Better scare a thief than snare him.

The Fox and the Lion
A fox that had never seen a lion, when by chance he met him for the first time, was so terrified that he almost died of fright. When he met him the second time, he was still afraid, but managed to disguise his fear. When he saw him the third time, he was so much emboldened that he went up to him and asked him how he did.
Familiarity breeds contempt.

The Bull, the Lioness, and the Wild-Boar Hunter
A bull, finding a lion's cub asleep, gored him to death with his horns. The lioness came up and bitterly lamented the death of her child. A wild-boar hunter, seeing her distress, stood afar off, and said to her; "Think how many men there are who have reason to lament the loss of their children, whose deaths have been caused by you."

The Lion and Ass Hunting
Lion and an ass made an agreement to go out hunting together. By and by they came to a cave, where many wild goats abode. The lion took up his station at the mouth of the cave and the ass, going within, kicked and brayed and made a mighty fuss to frighten them out. When the lion had caught many of them, the ass came out and asked him if he had not made a noble fight, and routed the goats properly.
"Yes, indeed," said the lion, "and I assure you, you would have frightened me too, if I had not known you to be an ass."
When braggarts are admitted into the company of their betters, it is only to be made use of and be laughed at.

The Kingdom of the Lion
The beasts of the field and forest had a lion as their king. He was neither wrathful, cruel, nor tyrannical, but he was just and gentle as a king could be. He made during his reign a royal proclamation for a general assembly of all the birds and beasts, and drew up conditions for a universal league, in which the wolf and the lamb, the panther and the kid, the tiger and the stag, the dog and the hare, should live together in perfect peace and amity. The hare said; "Oh, how I have longed to see this day, in which the weak shall take their place without fear by the side of the strong."

The Lion, the Ass, and the Fox
The lion, the ass, and the fox formed a party to go out hunting. They took a large booty and, when the sport was ended, thought to have a hearty meal.
The lion bade the ass to share the spoil. So, dividing it into three equal parts, the ass begged his friends to make their choice. The lion, in great indignation, fell upon the ass and tore him to pieces.
The lion then bade the fox to make a division. Gathering the whole into one great heap, the fox reserved but the smallest mite for himself. "Ah, friend," said the lion, "who taught you to make so equitable a division?" "I wanted no other lesson," replied the fox, "than the ass' fate."
Better be wise by the misfortunes of others than by your own.

The Ass in the Lion's Skin
An ass, having put on a lion's skin, roamed about, frightening all the silly animals he met with. Seeing a fox, he tried to alarm him also. But Reynard, having heard his voice, said, "Well, to be sure! And I should have been frightened too, if I had not heard you bray."
They who assume a character that does not belong to them generally betray themselves.

The Sick Lion
A lion, no longer able from the weakness of old age to hunt for his prey, laid himself up in his den. Breathing with great difficulty and speaking with a low voice, the lion gave out that he was very ill indeed. The report soon spread among the beasts and there was great lamentation for the sick lion. One after the other came to see him. Catching him thus alone, and in his own den, the lion made an easy prey of them and grew fat upon his diet.
The fox, suspecting the truth of the matter, came at length to make his visit of inquiry and, standing at some distance, asked his Majesty how he did. "Ah, my dearest friend," said the lion, "is it you? Why do you stand so far from me? Come, sweet friend, and pour a word of consolation in the poor lion's ear, who has but a short time to live."
"Bless you!" said the fox, "but excuse me if I cannot stay. For, to tell the truth, I feel quite uneasy at the mark of the footsteps that I see here, all pointing towards your den, and none returning outwards."
Affairs are easier of entrance than of exit and it is but common prudence to see our way out before we venture in.

The Old Lion
A lion, worn out with years, lay stretched upon the ground utterly helpless and drawing his last breath. A boar came up and, to satisfy an ancient grudge, drove at him with his tusks. Next a bull, determined to be revenged on an old enemy, gored him with his horns.
Upon this an ass, seeing that the old lion could thus be treated with impunity, thought that he would show his spite also. He came and threw his heels in the lion's face, whereupon the dying beast exclaimed; "The insults of the powerful were bad enough; those I could have managed to bear. But to be spurned by so base a creature as thou, the disgrace of nature, is to die a double death."

The Lion and the Goat
On a summer's day, when everything was suffering from extreme heat, a lion and a goat came at the same time to quench their thirst at a small fountain. They at once fell to quarrelling which should first drink of the water, till at length it seemed that each was determined to resist the other even to death.
But, ceasing from the strife for a moment, to recover breath, they saw a flock of vultures hovering over them, only waiting to pounce upon whichever of them should fall. Whereupon they instantly made up their quarrel, agreeing that it was far better for them both to become friends, than to furnish food for the crows and vultures.

The Lion, the Bear, and the Fox
A lion and a bear found the carcass of a fawn and had a long fight for it. The contest was so hard and even that, at last, both of them, half-blinded and half-dead, lay panting on the ground, without strength to touch the prize that was stretched between them. A fox coming by at the time, and seeing their helpless condition, stepped in between the combatants and carried off the booty.
"Poor creatures that we are," cried they, "who have been exhausting all our strength and injuring one another, merely to give a rogue a dinner!"

The Lioness
There was a great stir made among all the beasts, as to which could boast of the largest family. So they came to the lioness. "And how many," said they, "do you have at a birth?" "One," said she, grimly; "but that one is a lion."

The Lion and the Bulls
Three bulls fed in a field together in the greatest peace and amity. A lion had long watched them in the hope of making a prize of them, but found there was little chance for him so long as they kept all together. He therefore began secretly to spread evil and slanderous reports of one against the other, till he had fomented a jealousy and distrust amongst them.
No sooner did the lion see that they avoided one another and fed each by himself apart, than he fell upon them singly, and so made an easy prey of them all.
The quarrels of friends are the opportunities of foes.

The Man and the Lion
Once upon a time a man and a lion were journeying together and came at length to high words, which was the braver and stronger creature of the two. As the dispute waxed warmer they happened to pass by, on the roadside, a statue of a man strangling a lion. "See there," said the man; "what more undeniable proof can you have of our superiority than that?" "That," said the lion, "is your version of the story; let us be the sculptors, and for one lion under the feet of a man, you?ll have twenty men under the paw of a lion."

The Lion and the Mouse
A lion was sleeping in his lair when a mouse, not knowing where he was going, ran over the mighty beast's nose and awakened him. The lion clapped his paw upon the frightened little creature and was about to make an end of him in a moment, when the mouse, in pitiable tone, besought him to spare one who had so unconsciously offended, and not stain his honorable paws with so insignificant a prey. The Lion, smiling at his little prisoner's fright, generously let him go.
Now it happened that a short time later the Lion, while ranging the woods for his prey, fell into the toils of the hunters. Finding himself entangled without hope of escape, he set up a roar that filled the whole forest with its echo.
The mouse, recognizing the voice of his former benefactor, ran to the spot and, without more ado, set to work to nibble the knot in the cord that bound the lion. In a short time the mouse set the noble beast at liberty, thus convincing him that kindness is seldom thrown away and that there is no creature so much below another but that he may have it in his power to return a good favor.

The Goose with the Golden Eggs
A certain man had the good fortune to possess a goose that laid him a Golden Egg every day. But dissatisfied with so slow an income, and thinking to seize the whole treasure at once, he killed the Goose; and cutting her open, found her just what any other goose would be!

The Old Man and Death
An old man that had traveled a long way with a huge bundle of sticks, found himself so weary that he cast it down and called upon Death to deliver him from his most miserable existence. Death came straightway at his call and asked him what he wanted. "Pray, good sir," says he, "does me but the favor to help me up with my burden again."
It is one thing to call for Death and another to see him coming.

The Old Woman and the Wine Jar
An old woman saw an empty wine jar lying on the ground. Though not a drop of the wine with which it had been filled, remained, it still yielded a grateful fragrance to the passersby. The old woman, applying her nose as close as she could and snuffing with all her might, exclaimed, "Sweet creature! How charming must your contents once have been, when the very dregs are so delicious!"

The Belly and Its Members
In former days, a man's limbs did not work together as amicably as they do now, but each had a will and way of its own. One time the bodily members began to find fault with the belly for spending an idle, luxurious life, while they were wholly occupied in laboring for its support and ministering to its wants and pleasures. So the members entered into a conspiracy to cut off the belly?s supplies for the future. The hands were no longer to carry food to the mouth, nor the mouth to receive the food, nor the teeth to chew it.
They had not long persisted in this course of starving the belly into subjection, before they all began, one by one, to fail and flag, and the whole body to pine away. Then the members were convinced that the belly, cumbersome and useless as it seemed, had an important function of its own. They decided that they could no more do without it than it could do without them, and that if they would have the constitution of the body in a healthy state, they must work together, each in his proper sphere, for the common good of all.

The Peasant and the Apple Tree
A peasant had in his garden an apple tree that bore no fruit, but only served as a perch for the sparrows and grasshoppers. He resolved to cut it down and, taking his axe in hand, made a bold stroke at its roots. The grasshoppers and sparrows entreated him not to cut down the tree that sheltered them, but to spare it, and they would sing to him and lighten his labors.
The peasant paid no attention to their request, but gave the tree a second and a third blow with his axe. When he reached the hollow of the tree, he found a hive full of honey. Having tasted the honeycomb, he threw down his axe and, looking on the tree as sacred, took great care of it.
Self interest alone moves some men.

The Travelers and the Hatchet
Two men were traveling along the same road when one of them, picking up a hatchet, cried, "See what I have found!" "Do not say I," says the other, "but we have found."
After a while, up came the men who had lost the hatchet and charged the man who had it with the theft. "Alas," says he to his companion, "we are undone!" "Do not say we," replies the other, "but I am undone; for he that will not allow his friend to share the prize, must not expect him to share the danger."

The Bald Knight
A certain knight grew old, his hair fell off, and he became bald. To hide the imperfection he wore a wig. But as he was riding out hunting with some others, a sudden gust of wind blew off the wig and exposed his bald pate. The company could not avoid laughing at the accident, and he himself laughed as loud as anybody, saying, "How could I expect to keep strange hair upon my head, when my own would not stay there?"

The Boy and the Scorpion
A boy was hunting locusts upon a wall and had caught a great number of them. Seeing a scorpion, he mistook it for another locust, and was just hollowing his hand to catch it. The Scorpion, lifting up his stinger, said, "I wish you had done it, for I would soon have made you drop me and the locusts in the bargain."

The Hunter and the Woodsman
A man went lion hunting in a forest where, meeting with a woodsman, he asked him if he had seen any tracks of a lion and if he knew where his lair was. "Yes," said the man, "and if you will come with me I will show you the lion himself."
At this the hunter, turning ghastly pale, and his teeth chattering, said, "Oh! Thank you; it was the lion's track, not himself that I was hunting."
A coward can be a hero at a distance; it is presence of danger that tests presence of mind.

The Country Maid and Her Milk Can
A country maid was walking along with a can of milk upon her head, when she fell into the following train of reflections. "The money for which I shall sell this milk will enable me to increase my stock of eggs to three hundred. These eggs, allowing for what may prove addle and what may be destroyed by vermin, will produce at least two hundred and fifty chickens.
"The chickens will be fit to carry to market just at the time when poultry is always dear; so that by the New Year I cannot fail of having money enough to purchase a new gown. Green let me consider yes, green becomes my complexion best, and green it shall be. In this dress I will go to the fair, where all the young fellows will strive to have me for a partner, but no I shall refuse every one of them, and with a disdainful toss turn from them."
Transported with this idea, she could not forbear acting with her head the thought that thus passed in her mind, when down came the can of milk! And all her imaginary happiness vanished in a moment.

The Astronomer
An astronomer used to walk out every night to gaze upon the stars. It happened one night that, as he was wandering in the outskirts of the city, with his whole thoughts rapt up in the skies, he fell into a well. On his hollering and calling out, one who heard his cries ran up to him and, when he had listened to his story, said; "My good man, while you are trying to pry into the mysteries of heaven, you overlook the common objects that are under your feet."

The Seaside Travelers
As some travelers were making their way along the seashore, they came to a high cliff and, looking out upon the sea, saw a bundle of sticks floating at a distance. At first they thought it must be a large ship, so they waited, expecting to see it come into harbor. As the bundle drifted nearer to the shore, they thought it no longer to be a ship, but a boat. But when it was at length thrown on the beach, they saw that it was nothing but a bundle of sticks after all.
Dangers seem greatest at a distance and coming events are magnified according to the interest or inclination of the beholder.

The Two Wallets
Every man carries two wallets, one before and one behind, and both are full of faults. The one before is full of his neighbor's faults; the one behind, of his own. Thus it happens that men are blind to their own faults but never lose sight of their neighbor's.

The Mountebank and the Countryman
A certain wealthy patrician, intending to treat the Roman people with some theatrical entertainment, publicly offered a reward to anyone who would produce a novel spectacle. Incited by emulation, artists arrived from all parts to contest the prize, among which a well-known witty mountebank gave out that he had a new kind of entertainment that had never yet been produced on any stage. This report being spread abroad brought the whole city together.
The theatre could hardly contain the number of spectators. When the artist appeared alone upon the stage, without any apparatus or any assistants, curiosity and suspense kept the spectators in profound silence. On a sudden he thrust down his head into his bosom, and mimicked the squeaking of a young pig, so naturally, that the audience insisted upon it that he had one under his cloak and ordered him to be searched. When none was found they loaded him with the most extravagant applause.
A countryman among the audience observed what passed. "Oh!" said he, "I can do better than this," and immediately gave out that he would perform the next day.
Accordingly, on the morrow, a yet greater crowd was collected. Prepossessed, however, in favor of the mountebank, they came rather to laugh at the countryman than to pass a fair judgment on him. They both came out upon the stage.
The mountebank grunts away first and calls forth the greatest clapping and applause. Then the countryman, pretending that he concealed a little pig under his garments (and he had, in fact, really got one), pinched its ear until he made it squeak.
The people cried out that the mountebank had imitated the pig much more naturally and hooted to the countryman to quit the stage. But he, to convict them to their face, produced a real pig from his bosom. "And now, gentlemen, you may see," said he, "what a pretty sort of judges you are!"
It is easier to convince a man against his senses than against his will.

The Mole and Her Mother
Said a young mole to her mother, "mother, I can see." So, in order to try her, her mother put a lump of frankincense before her and asked her what it was. "A stone," said the young one. "O, my child!" said the mother, "not only do you not see, but you cannot even smell."
Brag upon one defect and betray another.

The Prophet
A wizard, sitting in the marketplace, told the fortunes of the passersby. A person ran up in great haste, announcing to him that the doors of his house had been broken open and that all his goods were being stolen. He sighed heavily and hastened away as fast as he could run.
A neighbor saw him running, and said; "Oh! You fellow there! You say you can foretell the fortunes of others; how is it you did not foresee your own?"

The Hunter and the Fisherman
A hunter was returning from the mountains loaded with game and a fisherman was at the same time coming home with his creel full of fish, when they chanced to meet by the way. The hunter took a fancy to a dish of fish, and the fisher preferred a supper of game. So each gave to the other the contents of his basket. They continued daily to exchange provisions, till one who had observed them said; "Now, by this invariable interchange, will they destroy the zest of their meal, and each will soon wish to return to his own store again."

The Bees, the Drones, and the Wasp
Some bees had built their comb in the hollow trunk of an oak. The drones asserted that it was their doing and belonged to them. The cause was brought into court before Judge Wasp.
Knowing something of the parties, he thus addressed them: "The plaintiffs and defendants are so much alike in shape and color as to render the ownership a doubtful matter, and the case has very properly been brought before me. The ends of justice, and the object of the court, will best be furthered by the plan which I propose. Let each party take a hive to itself, and build up a new comb, that from the shape of the cells and the taste of the honey, the lawful proprietors of the property in dispute may appear."
The bees readily assented to the wasp's plan. The drones declined it. Whereupon the wasp gave judgment: "It is clear now who made the comb and who cannot make it; the Court adjudges the honey to the bees."

The Ant and the Grasshopper
On a cold frosty day an ant was dragging out some of the corn that he had laid up in summer time, to dry it. A grasshopper, half-perished with hunger, besought the ant to give him a morsel of it to preserve his life.
"What were you doing," said the ant, "this last summer?"
"Oh," said the grasshopper, "I was not idle. I kept singing all the summer long."
The ant, laughing and shutting up his granary, said, "Since you could sing all summer, you may dance all winter."
Winter finds out what summer lays by.

The Miser
A miser, to make sure of his property, sold all that he had and converted it into a great lump of gold. He then hid the gold in a hole in the ground and went continually to visit and inspect it.
This roused the curiosity of one of his workmen, who, suspecting that there was a treasure, when his master's back was turned, went to the spot, and stole it away.
When the miser returned and found the place empty, he wept and tore his hair. A neighbor who saw him in this extravagant grief, and learned the cause of it, said, "Fret yourself no longer, but take a stone and put it in the same place. Think that it is your lump of gold. As you never meant to use it, the one will do you as much good as the other."
The worth of money is not in its possession, but in its use.

The Fisherman
A fisherman went to a river to fish. When he had laid his nets across the stream, he tied a stone to a long cord and beat the water on either side of the net to drive the fish into the meshes. One of the neighbors that lived nearby, seeing him thus employed, went up to him and blamed him exceedingly for disturbing the water and making it so muddy as to be unfit to drink. "I am sorry," said the fisherman, "that this does not please you, but it is by thus troubling the waters that I gain my living."

The Widow and the Sheep
There was a certain widow who had an only sheep and, wishing to make the most of his wool, she sheared him so closely that she cut his skin as well as his fleece.
The sheep, smarting under this treatment, cried out: "Why do you torture me thus? What will my blood add to the weight of the wool? If you want my flesh, dame, send for the butcher, who will put me out of my misery at once. If you want fleece, send for the shearer, who will clip my wool without drawing my blood."

The Rich Man and the Tanner
A rich man lived near a tanner and, not liking the unpleasant smell of the tan-yard, he pressed his neighbor to go away. The tanner put off his departure from time to time, saying that he would remove soon. As he still continued to stay, it came to pass, as time went on, that the rich man became accustomed to the smell, and made no further complaints.

The Cobbler Turned Doctor
Unable to make a living by his trade, a cobbler, rendered desperate by poverty, began to practice medicine in a town in which he was not known. He sold a drug that he claimed was an antidote to all poisons, and obtained a great name for himself by long-winded puffs and advertisements.
He happened to fall sick of a serious illness, on which the governor of the town determined to test his skill. For this purpose he called for a cup and, while filling it with water, pretended to mix poison with the cobbler's antidote and commanded him to drink it, on the promise of a reward.
The cobbler, under the fear of death, confessed that he had no knowledge of medicine and was only made famous by the stupid clamors of the crowd. At this the governor called a public assembly and thus addressed the citizens; "Of what folly have you been guilty? You have not hesitated to entrust your heads to a man whom no one would employ to make even the shoes for their feet."

The Hedge and the Vineyard
A foolish young heir, who had just come into possession of his wise father's estate, caused all the hedges about his vineyard to be grubbed up, because they bore no grapes. The throwing down of the fences laid his grounds open to man and beast, and all his vines were presently destroyed. So the simple fellow learned, when it was too late, that he ought not to expect to gather grapes from brambles, and that it was quite as important to protect his vineyard as to possess it.

The Two Men Who were Enemies
Two men who were enemies sailed on the same vessel. Determined to keep as far apart as possible, one seated himself in the stern and the other in the prow of the ship. A violent storm having arisen, and the vessel being in great danger of sinking, the one in the stern inquired of the pilot which of the two ends of the ship would go down first. On his replying that he supposed it would be the prow, then said the man; "Death would not be grievous to me, if I could only see my enemy die before me."

The Collier and the Fuller
A collier, who had more room in his house than he wanted for himself, proposed to a fuller to come and take up his quarters with him. "Thank you," said the fuller, "but I must decline your offer. I fear that as fast as I whiten my goods you will blacken them again."
There can be little liking where there is no likeness.

The Panther and the Shepherds
A panther, by some mischance, fell into a pit. The shepherds discovered him, threw sticks at him, and pelted him with stones. Some of them, moved with compassion towards one about to die even though no one should hurt him, threw in some food to prolong his life. At night they returned home, not dreaming of any danger, but supposing that on the morrow they should find him dead.
The panther, however, when he had recruited his feeble strength, freed himself with a sudden bound from the pit and hastened home with rapid steps to his den. After a few days he came forth and slaughtered the cattle and, killing the shepherds who had attacked him, raged with angry fury.
Then they who had spared his life, fearing for their safety, surrendered to him their flocks and begged only for their lives. To this the Panther made this reply: "I remember alike those who sought my life with stones and those who gave me food. Lay aside, therefore, your fears; I return as an enemy only to those who injured me."

The Flies and the Honey Pot
A pot of honey was upset in a grocer's shop, so the flies came around it in swarms to eat it up. They would not move from the spot while there was a drop left. At length their feet became so clogged that they could not fly away, and stifled in the luscious sweets they exclaimed; "Miserable creatures that we are, who for the sake of an hour's pleasure, have thrown away our lives!"

The Boy and the Filberts
A certain boy put his hand into a pitcher where a great plenty of figs and filberts were deposited. He grasped as many as his fist could possibly hold, but when he endeavored to pull it out, the narrowness of the neck prevented him. Unwilling to lose any of them, but unable to draw out his hand, he burst into tears and bitterly wailed about his bad fortune. An honest fellow, who stood by, gave him this wise and reasonable advice: "Grasp only half the quantity, my boy, and you will easily succeed."

The Pilgrim and the Sword
A Pilgrim on his way found a sword, and asked of the sword, "What is he that hath lost thee?" The sword answered to the Pilgrim, "A man alone hath lost me, but many a one have I lost." And therefore an evil man may be lost, but ere he be lost he may well harm many a one.

The Dolphins and the Sprat
The dolphins and the whales were at war with one another, and while the battle was at its height, a sprat stepped in and endeavored to separate them. One of the dolphins cried out, "Let us alone, friend! We had rather perish in the contest, than be reconciled by you."

The Shepherd and the Sea
A shepherd moved his flock to feed near the shore. Beholding the sea lying in a smooth and breathless calm, he was seized with a strong desire to sail over it. So he sold all his sheep, bought a cargo of dates, loaded a vessel, and set sail. He had not gone far when a storm arose; his ship was wrecked, and his dates and everything was lost. He, with difficulty, was able to reach land.
Not long after, when the sea was again calm and one of his friends came up to him and was admiring its repose, he said, "Have a care, my good fellow, of that smooth surface; it is only looking out for your dates."

The Angler and the Little Fish
An angler, who gained his livelihood by fishing, after a long day's toil, caught nothing but one little fish. "Spare me," said the little creature, "I beseech you. Small as I am, I shall make you but a sorry meal. I am not come to my full size yet. Throw me back into the river for the present and then, when I am grown bigger and worth eating, you may come here and catch me again."
"No, no," said the man; "I have got you now, but if you once get back into the water, your tune will be, 'Catch me, if you can.' "
A bird in the hand is worth two in the bush.

The Great and the Little Fishes
A fisherman was drawing up a net that he had cast into the sea, full of all sorts of fish. The little fish escaped through the meshes of the net and got back into the deep. The great fish, however, were all caught and hauled into the ship.
Our insignificance is often the cause of our safety.

The Bald Man and the Fly
A little fly pricked a man on his bald head. He swatted at her, but she flew away, so he struck himself. The fly began to laugh and the bald man said to her, "Ha, an evil beast! You demand well your death if I struck myself, and you laugh and mock when I did that. But if I had hit you, you would have died."
Men ought not to laugh or scorn the evil of others.

The Two Pots
Two pots, one of earthenware, the other of brass, were carried down a river in a flood. The brazen pot begged his companion to keep by his side, and he would protect him. "Thank you for your offer," said the earthen pot, "but that is just what I am afraid of. If you will only keep at a distance, I may float down in safety; but should we come in contact, I am sure to be the sufferer."
Avoid too powerful neighbors; for, should there be a collision, the weakest goes to the wall.

The Travelers and the Bear
Two friends were traveling on the same road together when they met with a bear. The one in great fear, without a thought of his companion, climbed up into a tree and hid himself. The other friend, seeing that he had no chance, single-handed, against the bear, had nothing left but to throw himself on the ground and feign to be dead, for he had heard that the bear will never touch a dead body.
As he thus laid, the bear came up to his head, nuzzling and snuffing at his nose, and ears, and heart, but the man immovably held his breath, and the beast supposing him to be dead, walked away.
When the bear was fairly out of sight, his companion came down out of the tree, and asked what it was that the Bear whispered to him; "for," says he, "I observed he put his mouth very close to your ear."
"Why," replied the other, "it was no great secret. He only bade me have a care how I kept company with those who, when they get into a difficulty, leave their friends in the lurch."

The Trumpeter Taken Prisoner
A trumpeter being taken prisoner in a battle, begged hard for quarter. "Spare me, good sirs, I beseech you," said he, "and put me not to death without cause, for I have killed no one myself, nor have I any arms but this trumpet only." "For that very reason," said they who had seized him, "shall you the sooner die, for without the spirit to fight, yourself, you stir up others to warfare and bloodshed."
He who incites strife is worse than he who takes part in it.

The Two Soldiers and the Robber
Two soldiers traveling together were attacked by a robber. One fled away; the other stood his ground and defended himself with his stout right hand. The robber being slain, the timid companion runs up and draws his sword, and then, throwing back his traveling cloak, says; "I'll have at him, and I'll take care that he shall learn whom he has attacked!"
On hearing this, he who had fought with the robber made answer: "I only wish that you had helped me just now, even if it had been only with those words, for I should have been the more encouraged, believing them to be true. But now put up your sword in its sheath and hold your equally useless tongue, till you can deceive others who do not know you. I, indeed, who have experienced with what speed you run away, know right well that no dependence can be placed on your valor."

The Crab and Her Mother
Said an old crab to a young one, "Why do you walk so crooked, child? Walk straight!" "Mother," said the young crab, "show me the way, will you? And when I see you taking a straight course, I will try to follow."

The Doctor and His Patient
A doctor had been for some time attending upon a sick man who, however, died under his hands. At the funeral the doctor went about among the relations, saying; "Our poor friend, if he had only refrained from wine, attended to his insides, and used proper means, would not have been lying there."
One of the mourners answered him, "My good sir, it is of no use your saying this now; you ought to have prescribed these things when your patient was alive to take them."
The best advice may come too late.

The Three Tradesmen
There was a city in expectation of being besieged and a council was called accordingly to discuss the best means of fortifying it. A bricklayer gave his opinion that no material was so good as brick for the purpose. A carpenter begged leave to suggest that timber would be far preferable. Upon which a currier started up and said, "Sirs, when you have said all that can be said, there is nothing in the world like leather."

The Boasting Traveler
A man who had been traveling in foreign parts, on his return home was always bragging and boasting of the great feats he had accomplished in different places. In Rhodes, for instance, he said he had taken such an extraordinary leap, that no man could come near him, and he had witnesses there to prove it. "Possibly," said one of his hearers; "but if this be true, just suppose this to be Rhodes and try the leap again."

The Countryman and the Snake
A countryman returning home one winter's day found a snake by the hedge-side, half dead with cold. Taking compassion on the creature, he laid it in his bosom and brought it home to his fireside to revive it. No sooner had the warmth restored it, than it began to attack the children of the cottage. Upon this the countryman, whose compassion had saved its life, took up a club and laid the snake dead at his feet.

The Miller, His Son, and Their Ass
A miller and his son were driving their ass to a neighboring fair to sell him. They had not gone far when they met with a troop of girls returning from the town, talking and laughing. "Look there!" cried one of them, "did you ever see such fools, to be trudging along the road on foot, when they might be riding!"
The old man, hearing this, quietly bade his son get on the ass, and walked along merrily by the side of him. Presently they came up to a group of old men in earnest debate. "There!" said one of them, "it proves what I was saying. What respect is shown to old age in these days? Do you see that idle young rogue riding, while his old father has to walk? Get down, you scapegrace! And let the old man rest his weary limbs."
Upon this the father made his son dismount and got up himself. In this manner they had not proceeded far when they met a company of women and children. "Why, you lazy old fellow!" cried several tongues at once, "how can you ride upon the beast, while that poor little lad there can hardly keep pace by the side of you?"
The good-natured miller stood corrected and immediately took up his son behind him. They had now almost reached the town. "Pray, honest friend," said a townsman, "is that ass your own?" "Yes," said the old Man. "Oh! One would not have thought so," said the other, "by the way you load him. Why, you two fellows are better able to carry the poor beast than he you!" "Anything to please you," said the old man; "we can but try."
So, alighting with his son, they tied the ass' legs together and by the help of a pole endeavored to carry him on their shoulders over a bridge that led to the town. This was so entertaining a sight that the people ran out in crowds to laugh at it, till the ass, not liking the noise or his situation, kicked asunder the cords that bound him and, tumbling off the pole, fell into the river.
Upon this the old man, vexed and ashamed, made his way home, convinced that by endeavoring to please everybody he had pleased nobody and lost his ass in the bargain.

The Lion in Love
It happened in the days of old that a lion fell in love with a woodsman's daughter and had the folly to ask her of her father in marriage. The woodsman was not much pleased with the offer and declined the honor of so dangerous an alliance.
Upon the lion threatening him with his royal displeasure, the poor man, seeing that so formidable a creature was not to be denied, hit at length upon this expedient: "I feel greatly flattered," said he, "with your proposal. But, noble sir, what great teeth you have got! And what great claws you have got! Where is the damsel that would not be frightened at such weapons as these? You must have your teeth drawn and your claws pared before you can be a suitable bridegroom for my daughter."
The lion straightway submitted, for what will not a body do for love, and then called upon the father to accept him as a son-in-law. But the woodsman, no longer afraid of the tamed and disarmed bully, seized a stout cudgel and drove the unreasonable suitor from his door.

The Farmer and His Sons
A farmer being on the point of death and wishing to show his sons the way to success in farming, called them to him, and said; "My children, I am now departing from this life, but all that I have to leave you, you will find in the vineyard."
The sons, supposing that he referred to some hidden treasure, as soon as the old man was dead, set to work with their spades and ploughs and every implement that was at hand, and turned up the soil over and over again. They found indeed not treasure, but the vines, strengthened and improved by this thorough tillage, yielded a finer vintage than they had ever yielded before. This more than repaid the young husbandmen for all their trouble.
Industry is, in itself, a treasure.

The Laborer and the Snake
A snake, having made his hole close to the porch of a cottage, inflicted a severe bite on the cottager's infant son. The son subsequently died, to the great grief of his parents.
The father resolved to kill the snake and the next day, on its coming out of its hole for food, took up his axe. Making too much haste to hit him, the cottager missed the snake's head and cut off only the end of his tail.
After some time the cottager, afraid lest the snake should bite him also, endeavored to make peace and placed some bread and salt beside his hole. The snake, slightly hissing, said, "There can henceforth be no peace between us. For whenever I see you I shall remember the loss of my tail, and whenever you see me you will be thinking of the death of your son."
No one truly forgets injuries in the presence of him who caused the injury.

The Old Woman and the Physician
An old woman, who had become blind, called in a physician and promised him, before witnesses, that if he would restore her eyesight she would give him a most handsome reward. But, said she, if he did not cure her and her malady remained, he should receive nothing. The agreement being concluded, the physician tampered from time to time with the old lady's eyes and, meanwhile, bit by bit, carried off her goods.
At length after a time he set about the task in earnest and cured her and thereupon asked for the stipulated fee. But the old woman, on recovering her sight, saw none of her goods left in the house. When, therefore, the physician importuned her in vain for payment and she continually put him off with excuses, he summoned her at last before the judges.
Being now called upon for her defense, she said, "What this man says is true enough; I promised to give him his fee if my sight were restored and nothing if my eyes continued bad. Now then he says that I am cured, but I say just the contrary; for when my malady first came on, I could see all sorts of furniture and goods in my house; but now, when he says he has restored my sight, I cannot see one jot of either."
He who plays a trick must be prepared to take a joke.

The Father and His Two Daughters
A man who had two daughters married one to a gardener and the other to a potter. After a while he paid a visit to the gardener's home and asked his daughter how she was, and how it fared with her. "Excellently well," said she; "we have everything that we want; I have but one prayer, that we may have a heavy storm of rain to water our plants."
Off he went to the potter's home and asked his other daughter how matters were with her. "There is not a thing we want," she replied, "and I only hope this fine weather and hot sun may continue, to bake our tiles."
"Alas," said the father, "if you wish for fine weather, and your sister for rain, which am I to pray for myself?"

The Old Woman and Her Maids
A thrifty old widow kept two maidservants, whom she used to call up to their work at the cock?s first crowing. The maids exceedingly disliked this early rising and determined between themselves to wring off the cock's neck, as he was the cause of all their trouble by waking their mistress so early. They had no sooner done this than the old lady, missing her usual alarm and afraid of oversleeping herself, continually mistook the time of day and roused them up at midnight.
Too much cunning overreaches itself.

The Bundle of Sticks
A husbandman, who had a quarrelsome family, after having tried in vain to reconcile them by words, thought he might more readily prevail by an example. So he called his sons and bade them lay a bundle of sticks before him. Then having tied them into a faggot, he told the lads, one after the other, to take it up and break it. They all tried, but tried in vain.
Then untying the faggot, he gave them the sticks to break one by one. This they did with the greatest ease. Then said the father, "Thus you, my sons, as long as you remain united, are a match for all your enemies; but differ and separate, and you are undone."

The Thief and His Mother
A schoolboy stole a book from one of his schoolmates and brought it home to his mother. Instead of chastising him, she rather encouraged him in the deed. In course of time the boy, now grown into a man, began to steal things of greater value, till at length being caught in the very act, he was bound and led to execution.
Perceiving his mother following among the crowd, wailing and beating her breast, he begged the officers to be allowed to speak one word in her ear. When she quickly drew near and applied her ear to her son's mouth, he seized the lobe of it tightly between his teeth and bit it off. Upon this she cried out lustily, and the crowd joined her in upbraiding the unnatural son.
As if his former evil ways had not been enough, but that his last act must be a deed of impiety against his mother. But he replied; "It is she who is the cause of my ruin, for if when I stole my schoolmate's book and brought it to her, she had given me a sound flogging, I should never have so grown in wickedness as to come to this untimely end."

The Boy and the Nettle
A boy playing in the fields was stung by a nettle. He ran home to his mother, telling her that he had but touched that nasty weed and it had stung him. "It was just your touching it, my boy," said the mother, "that caused it to sting you; the next time you meddle with a nettle, grasp it tightly and it will do you no hurt."
Do boldly what you do at all.

The Boy Bathing
A boy was bathing in a river and, getting out of his depth, was on the point of sinking when he saw a wayfarer coming by. He called out for help with all his might and main. The man began to read the boy a lecture for his foolhardiness, but the urchin cried out; "O, save me now, sir! And read me the lecture afterwards."

The Man and His Two Wives
In days when a man was allowed more wives than one, a middle-aged bachelor, who could be called neither young nor old, and whose hair was only just beginning to turn grey, must needs fall in love with two women at once and marry them both. The one was young and blooming and wished her husband to appear as youthful as herself. The other was somewhat more advanced in age and was as anxious that her husband should appear a suitable match for her.
So, while the young one seized every opportunity of pulling out the good man's grey hairs, the old one was as industrious in plucking out every black hair she could find. For a time the man was highly gratified by their attention and devotion, till he found one morning that, between the one and the other, he had not a hair left.
He that submits his principles to the influence and caprices of opposite parties will end in having no principles at all.

The Countryman and the Snake
A countryman returning home one winter's day found a snake by the hedge-side, half dead with cold. Taking compassion on the creature, he laid it in his bosom and brought it home to his fireside to revive it. No sooner had the warmth restored it, than it began to attack the children of the cottage. Upon this the countryman, whose compassion had saved its life, took up a club and laid the snake dead at his feet.

The Serpent and the Eagle
A serpent and an eagle were struggling with each other in a deadly conflict. The serpent had the advantage, and was about to strangle the bird. A countryman saw them and, running up, loosed the coil of the serpent and let the eagle go free. The serpent, irritated at the escape of his prey, some time later injected his poison into the drinking cup of the countryman. The rustic, ignorant of his danger, was about to drink, when the eagle struck his hand with his wing and, seizing the drinking cup in his talons, carried it away.

The Laborer and the Snake
A snake, having made his hole close to the porch of a cottage, inflicted a severe bite on the cottager's infant son. The son subsequently died, to the great grief of his parents.
The father resolved to kill the snake and the next day, on its coming out of its hole for food, took up his axe. Making too much haste to hit him, the cottager missed the snake's head and cut off only the end of his tail.
After some time the cottager, afraid lest the snake should bite him also, endeavored to make peace and placed some bread and salt beside his hole. The snake, slightly hissing, said, "There can henceforth be no peace between us. For whenever I see you I shall remember the loss of my tail, and whenever you see me you will be thinking of the death of your son."
No one truly forgets injuries in the presence of him who caused the injury.

The Viper and the File
A viper entering into a smith's shop began looking about for something to eat. At length, seeing a file, he went up to it and commenced biting at it. But the file bade him leave him alone, saying, "You are likely to get little from me, whose business it is to bite others."

The Fowler and the Viper
A fowler, taking his birdlime and his twigs, went out to catch birds. Seeing a thrush sitting upon a tree, he wished to capture it, and fitting his twigs to a proper length, he watched intently, having his whole thoughts directed towards the sky.
While thus looking upwards, he unawares trod upon a viper asleep, just before his feet. The viper, turning towards him, bit him, and he, falling into a swoon, said to himself; "Woe is me! That while I tried to hunt another, I am myself fallen unawares into the snares of death."

The Hen and the Swallow
A hen, finding the eggs of a viper, and carefully keeping them warm, nourished them until they hatched. A swallow, observing what she had done, said; "You silly creature! Why have you hatched these vipers, which, when they shall have grown, will inflict injury on all, beginning with yourself?"

The Wasp and the Snake
A wasp seated himself upon the head of a snake and, striking him again and again with his stings, wounded him to death. The snake, being in great torment and not knowing how to rid himself of his enemy or to scare him away, saw a wagon heavily laden with wood and went and purposely placed his head under the wheels, and said; "My enemy and I shall thus perish together."

The Crow and the Serpent
A crow, in great want of food, saw a serpent asleep in a sunny nook and, flying down, greedily seized him. The serpent turned about and bit the crow with a mortal wound. The crow, in the agony of death, exclaimed, "Oh unhappy me! Who have found in that which I deemed a happy windfall the source of my destruction."

The Buck and the Vine
A buck, pursued by hunters, concealed himself among the branches of a vine. The hunters passed by without discovering him, and when he thought that all was safe, he began browsing upon the leaves that had concealed him. One of the hunters, attracted by the rustling, turned round and guessing that their prey was there, shot into the bush and killed him. As he was dying, he groaned out these words; "I suffer justly for my ingratitude, who could not forbear injuring the vine that had protected me in time of danger."

The Stag, the Wolf, and the Sheep
A stag asked a sheep to lend him a measure of wheat and said that the wolf would be his surety. The sheep, fearing some fraud was intended, excused herself, saying; "The wolf is accustomed to seize what he wants and to run off and you, too, can quickly outstrip me in your rapid flight. How then shall I be able to find either of you when the day of payment comes?"
Two blacks do not make one white.

The Fawn and Her Mother
A fawn one day said to her mother; "Mother, you are bigger than a dog and swifter and better winded, and you have horns to defend yourself. How is it that you are so afraid of the hounds?" She smiled and said; "All this, my child, I know full well; but no sooner do I hear a dog bark than, somehow or other, my heels take me off as fast as they can carry me."

The Sick Stag
A stag that had fallen sick lay down on the rich foliage of a lawn, close to a forest, that she might obtain an easy meal. But so many of the beasts came to see her, for she was a good sort of neighbor that, one taking a little and another a little, they ate up all the grass in the place. So, though recovering from the disease, she pined for want and in the end lost both her substance and her life.

The Stag at the Pool
A stag one summer's day came to a pool to quench his thirst, and as he stood drinking he saw his form reflected in the water. "What beauty and strength," said he, "are in these horns of mine; but how unseemly are these weak and slender feet!"
While he was thus criticizing, after his own fancies, the form which Nature had given him, the huntsmen and hounds drew that way. The feet, with which he had found so much fault, soon carried him out of reach of his pursuers; but the horns, of which he was so vain, becoming entangled in a thicket, held him till the hunters again came up to him, and proved the cause of his death
The Kingdom of the Lion
The beasts of the field and forest had a lion as their king. He was neither wrathful, cruel, nor tyrannical, but he was just and gentle as a king could be. He made during his reign a royal proclamation for a general assembly of all the birds and beasts, and drew up conditions for a universal league, in which the wolf and the lamb, the panther and the kid, the tiger and the stag, the dog and the hare, should live together in perfect peace and amity. The hare said; "Oh, how I have longed to see this day, in which the weak shall take their place without fear by the side of the strong."

The One-Eyed Doe
A doe that had but one eye used to graze near the sea. So that she might be more secure from attack, she kept her eye towards the land against the approach of the hunters and her blind side towards the sea, whence she feared no danger. But some sailors rowing by in a boat and seeing her aimed at her from the water and shot her. With her last gasp she sighed to herself: "Ill-fated creature that I am! I was safe on the land side whence I expected to be attacked, but find an enemy in the sea to which I most looked for protection."
Our troubles often come from the quarter where we least expect them.

The Horse and the Stag
A horse had the whole range of a meadow to himself, but a stag come and damaged the pasture. The horse, anxious to have his revenge, asked a man if he could not assist him in punishing the stag. "Yes," said the man, "only let me put a bit in your mouth and get upon your back and I will find the weapons." The horse agreed and the man mounted accordingly. But instead of getting his revenge, the horse has been from that time forward the slave of man.
Revenge is too dearly purchased at the price of liberty.

The Stag in the Ox Stall
A hunted stag, driven out of the thicket and distracted by fear, made for the first farmhouse he saw and hid himself in an ox stall which happened to be open. As he was trying to conceal himself under the straw, "What can you mean," said an ox, "by running into such certain destruction as to trust yourself to the haunts of man?" "Only do you not betray me," said the stag, "and I shall be off again on the first opportunity."
Evening came on; the herdsman foddered the cattle, but observed nothing. The other farm-servants came in and out. The stag was still safe. Presently the bailiff passed through; all seemed right. The stag, now feeling himself quite secure, began to thank the oxen for their hospitality. "Wait a while," said one of them, "we indeed wish you well, but there is yet another person, one with a hundred eyes; if he should happen to come this way I fear your life will be still in jeopardy."
While he was speaking, the master, having finished his supper, came round to see that all was safe for the night, for he thought that his cattle had not of late looked as well as they ought. Going up to the rack, "Why so little fodder here?" says he. "Why is there not more straw?" And "How long, I wonder, would it take to sweep down these cobwebs!" Prying and observing, here and there and everywhere, the stag's antlers, jutting from out the straw, caught his eye, and calling in his servants he instantly made prize of him.

The Monkey and the Camel
At a great meeting of the beasts, the monkey stood up to dance. Having greatly distinguished himself, and being applauded by all present, it moved the spleen of the camel, who came forward and began to dance also. But he made himself so utterly absurd, that all the beasts in indignation set upon him with clubs and drove him out of the ring.

The Arab and the Camel
An Arab having loaded his camel asked him whether he preferred to go up hill or down hill. "Pray, Master," said the camel dryly, "is the straight way across the plain 'shut up?"

The Camel
When man first saw the camel, he was so frightened at his vast size that he fled away. After a time, perceiving the meekness and gentleness of his temper, he summoned courage enough to approach him. Soon afterwards, observing that he was an animal altogether deficient in spirit, he assumed such boldness as to put a bridle in his mouth and to set a child to drive him.
Use serves to overcome dread.

Jupiter and the Camel
When the camel, in days of yore, besought Jupiter to grant him horns, for that it was a great grief to him to see other animals furnished with them, while he had none. Jupiter not only refused to give him the horns he asked for, but cropped his ears short for his importunity.
By asking too much, we may lose the little that we had before.

The Mouse and the Bull
A bull was bitten by a mouse, and, pained by the wound, tried to capture him. The mouse, however, reached his hole in safety. The bull dug into the walls with his horns until, wearied, he crouched down and slept by the hole.
The mouse, peeping out, crept up his flank and, again biting him, retreated to his hole. The bull rising up, and not knowing what to do, was sadly perplexed. The mouse murmured, "The great do not always prevail."
There are times when the small and lowly are the strongest to do mischief.

The Frog and the Ox
An ox, grazing in a swampy meadow, chanced to set his foot among a parcel of young frogs and crushed nearly the whole brood to death. One that escaped ran off to his mother with the dreadful news; "And, O mother!" said he, "it was a big four-footed beast that did it!"
"Big?" quote the old frog. "How big? Was it as big"?and she puffed herself out to a great degree?"as big as that?" "Oh!" said the little one, "a great deal bigger than that." "Well, was it so big?" and she swelled herself out yet more.
"Indeed, mother, but it was; if you were to burst yourself, you would never reach half its size." Provoked at such a disparagement of her powers, the old frog made one more trial, and burst herself indeed.
Men are ruined by attempting a greatness to which they have no claim.

The Bull and the Calf
A bull was striving with all his might to squeeze himself through a narrow passage that led to his stall. A young calf came up and offered to go before and show him the way by which he could manage to pass. "Save yourself the trouble," said the bull. "I knew that way long before you were born.
The Bull, the Lioness, and the Wild-Boar Hunter
A bull, finding a lion's cub asleep, gored him to death with his horns. The lioness came up and bitterly lamented the death of her child. A wild-boar hunter, seeing her distress, stood afar off, and said to her; "Think how many men there are who have reason to lament the loss of their children, whose deaths have been caused by you."

The Herdsman and the Lost Bull
A herdsman, who had lost a bull, went roaming through the forest in search of it. Being unable to find it, he began to vow to all the nymphs of the forest and the mountain, to Mercury and to Pan, that he would offer up a lamb to them, if he could only discover the thief. At that moment, gaining a high ridge of ground, he sees a lion standing over the carcass of his beautiful bull. And now the unhappy man vows the bull into the bargain, if he may only escape from the thief's clutches.

The Stag in the Ox Stall
A hunted stag, driven out of the thicket and distracted by fear, made for the first farmhouse he saw and hid himself in an ox stall which happened to be open. As he was trying to conceal himself under the straw, "What can you mean," said an ox, "by running into such certain destruction as to trust yourself to the haunts of man?" "Only do you not betray me," said the stag, "and I shall be off again on the first opportunity."
Evening came on; the herdsman foddered the cattle, but observed nothing. The other farm-servants came in and out. The stag was still safe. Presently the bailiff passed through; all seemed right. The stag, now feeling himself quite secure, began to thank the oxen for their hospitality. "Wait a while," said one of them, "we indeed wish you well, but there is yet another person, one with a hundred eyes; if he should happen to come this way I fear your life will be still in jeopardy."
While he was speaking, the master, having finished his supper, came round to see that all was safe for the night, for he thought that his cattle had not of late looked as well as they ought. Going up to the rack, "Why so little fodder here?" says he. "Why is there not more straw?" And "How long, I wonder, would it take to sweep down these cobwebs!" Prying and observing, here and there and everywhere, the stag's antlers, jutting from out the straw, caught his eye, and calling in his servants he instantly made prize of him.

The Oxen and the Axle-Tree
As some oxen were dragging a wagon along a heavy road, the axle-trees set up a tremendous creaking. "Brute!" cried the driver to the wagon. "Why do you groan, when they who are drawing all the weight are silent?"
Those who cry loudest are not always the most hurt.

The Cattle and the Butchers
The cattle, once on a time, determined to make an end of the butchers, whose whole art, they said, was conceived for their destruction. So they assembled together and whetted their horns for the contest. A very old ox, who had long worked at the plough, then addressed them:
"Have a care, my friends, what you do. These men, at least, kill us with decency and skill, but if we fall into the hands of botchers instead of butchers, we shall suffer a double death; for be well assured, men will not go without beef, even though they are without butchers."

The Gnat and the Bull
A gnat that had been buzzing about the head of a bull, at length settling himself down upon his horn, begged his pardon for incommoding him. "But if," says he, "my weight at all inconveniences you, pray say so and I will be off in a moment." "Oh, never trouble your head about that," says the bull, "for 'tis all one to me whether you go or stay and, to tell the truth, I did not know you were there."
The smaller the mind the greater the conceit.

The Bull and the Goat
A bull, being pursued by a lion, fled into a cave where a wild goat had taken up his abode. The goat upon this began molesting him and butting at him with his horns. "Don't suppose," said the bull, "if I suffer this now, that it is you I am afraid of. Let the lion be once out of sight and I will soon show you the difference between a bull and a goat."

The Heifer and the Ox
A heifer that ran wild in the fields and had never felt the yoke, upbraided an ox at plow for submitting to such labor and drudgery. The ox said nothing, but went on with his work. Not long after, there was a great festival. The ox got his holiday, but the heifer was led off to be sacrificed at the altar. "If this be the end of your idleness," said the ox, "I think that my work is better than your play. I had rather my neck felt the yoke than the axe."

The Lion and the Bulls
Three bulls fed in a field together in the greatest peace and amity. A lion had long watched them in the hope of making a prize of them, but found there was little chance for him so long as they kept all together. He therefore began secretly to spread evil and slanderous reports of one against the other, till he had fomented a jealousy and distrust amongst them.
No sooner did the lion see that they avoided one another and fed each by himself apart, than he fell upon them singly, and so made an easy prey of them all.
The quarrels of friends are the opportunities of foes.

The Lion and the Cow, the Goat and the Sheep
The cow, the goat, and the sheep went hunting in the chase with a lion and they captured a deer. When it came time to part ways and share in their catch, the lion said to them, "My lords, I let you know that the first part is mine, because I am your lord; the second because I am stronger than you; the third because I ran more swift than you did; and whosoever touches the fourth part, he shall be my mortal enemy!"
And thus the lion took for himself alone the deer.

The Man, the Horse, the Ox, and the Dog
A horse, ox, and dog, driven to great straits by the cold, sought shelter and protection from a man. He received them kindly, lighted a fire, and warmed them. He allowed the horse to eat of his oats, gave the ox an abundance of hay, and fed the dog with meat from his own table.
Grateful for these favors, they determined to repay him to the best of their ability. They divided for this purpose the term of his life between them, and each endowed one portion of it with the qualities that chiefly characterized himself.
The horse chose the man's earliest years and endowed them with his own attributes. Hence every man is in youth impetuous, headstrong, and obstinate in maintaining his own opinion.
The ox took under his patronage the next term of life, and therefore man in his middle age is fond of work, devoted to labor, and resolute to amass wealth and to husband his resources.
The end of life was reserved to the dog, wherefore the old man is often snappish, irritable, hard to please, and selfish, tolerant only of his own household, but averse to strangers and to all who do not administer to his comfort or to his necessities.
